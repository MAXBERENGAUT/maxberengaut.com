            <p>The night had settled in the valley, and on top of the roof he could see the lights across the gulch that were the rest of the village. The eyes of the mountains around him looked blankly at Sam, darkness erasing any hope of making them out. Clouds were covering the sky, hiding the moonlight, but he could still see the ground slope down in front of him until it reached a small river. Above the river, he thought he could see the outline of a huge mountain, but he wasn’t sure, as it began to blur the longer he looked at it. He turned to Rudra, who had come up the stairs with Jordan close behind him. The two of them turned around in a circle, letting the atmosphere of the valley bring itself onto them. They looked back at Sam, who nodded in the direction of the invisible mountain.
            </p><p>“There’s something out there. We’ll prolly see it in the morning.”
            </p><p>They nodded. They had arrived on a minivan soon after the night had come with the rest of their group. Jordan looked around a bit, pacing back and forth from one edge of the roof to the other. Then he looked up and smiled. “What’s wrong with right here?” 
            </p><p>Rudra and Sam looked quickly at each other, frowning and then laughing. “No, Jordan, we definitely can’t.” 
            </p><p>“Ms. Williams’s room is right there underneath us.” 
            </p><p>Jordan shrugged. 
            </p>

        <section>
            <p>The day before they were in Marrakesh. Sam and Jordan had been split off from Rudra. Marrakesh’s main souk was a market the size of a neighborhood, every shop and street shut underneath the same large metal roof. Every few steps, a new shop would appear with its own wealth of sandals and purses, as well as store owner, earnestly beckoning them inside. After a few minutes, the network of streets had tangled up, and they were completely lost. Sam and Jordan were at the back of the group, looking around with everyone else, stopping with them at the crafts shops, but they were never interested in buying anything. They had one thing on their mind, and they were like rats for it. They spent all their days back home stuck in the same process, smoking until their vision blurred, walking around aimlessly, talking endlessly, before coming back to one of their houses so that they could do nothing for even longer. They wanted to do the same in Morocco.
            </p><p>Jordan nudged Sam, turning him around. They had somehow wandered into being at the front of the group, and the nearest kids were two sophomore girls absorbed in a nearby perfume shop. Sam nodded back to him in approval and Jordan disappeared into the alleyway next to them. All alone, Sam stood still as tourists and locals passed by him. He strained his eyes to look through the crowd to find Ms. Williams. She was trying to stop a freshman from buying a dagger, far away enough that he felt he wouldn’t have to worry. He glanced back at the alleyway. Jordan’s back wasn’t visible anymore; he must’ve turned off of it. His mental timer had already started and with it was an anxiety that started in his legs and slowly writhed its way up the rest of his body. He looked at a belt shop next to him, knowing that he might have to try to buy something to delay Ms. Williams. The store owner looked back at him. Sam glanced at the alleyway again even though he knew it would be empty, and then turned into the belt shop. He smiled and said hello to the store owner, then politely went around the shop, stopping every once and while to look a little closer at all the different colors and materials. 
            </p><p>Eventually he turned back to the street. The two girls he had seen before were by a jewelry stand in front of him. They noticed him and nodded. They’d never spoken before at school, but the trip had its way of attaching a familiarity. The girl on the right, Laura, frowned.
            </p><p>“Where’s Jordan?”. 
            </p><p>“Well, you know”. He nodded across the street to the empty alleyway. They turned around, and then looked back blankly. Then Laura’s eyebrows raised, and her gaze on him hardened. “Oh”. Sam felt cornered. 
            </p><p>“Have fun with that”, her friend said, bitingly, but Sam hadn’t heard her. Laura’s eyes had caught his and he couldn’t find anything to say. She was touching her cross necklace, looking at him, and seeing straight through him. It glinted in the light sliding through the patchwork roof. Her friend turned around.
            </p><p>“Ms. Williams will be here soon.” 
            </p><p>“Yeah, I know. That’s why I’m trying to buy a belt. To delay”, he added, finding words to make up for the lull in air he felt coming. Laura grabbed her friend and took her across the street to Ms. Williams, who had come much closer since Sam had last looked. Sam turned back to the empty alleyway. Jordan had to come back soon, even if he couldn’t find any to buy, he had to know that he couldn’t be gone this long. Laura was talking earnestly to Ms. Williams about something in the store, but she had already seen Sam awkwardly standing in the belt shop.
            </p><p>Ms. Williams had made it clear in the airport that she was keeping an eye on them. Sam didn’t take French, but Jordan did, and that was enough. She walked across the street purposefully. 
            </p><p>“I’m buying a belt!”. Sam held it up in his right hand. 
            </p><p>Ms. Williams ignored him. “Where’s Jordan Sam?”. 
            </p><p>Sam had taken his wallet out in the meantime and looked up at her as if she were less important than the belt. “Huh? Oh Jordan. He’s over that way”, pointing his hand flimsily out of the store. She didn’t seem to buy it, but as she turned, Jordan was indeed right there. He was standing by himself in front of the store, trying to look around Ms. Williams to make eye contact with Sam so he could grin.

            <p>The next day he and Jordan were sitting at the back of the minivan as they started out for the village, five hours away from Marrakesh. Rudra sat in front of Jordan in the row in front of him, and across from Rudra in front of Sam was Sadie. Rudra and Sadie were turned around to talk to them. They hardly ever talked to anyone else on the trip, partly because they were the only juniors, but also because they didn’t have much interest in the other kids. They’d all been friends now for a few years, and there was no reason to stray away from each other. It wasn’t weird with Sadie there, as Sam had thought it could have been before the trip. Sadie was as much in on their jokes as she could be and was always able to turn the conversation back on herself if it diverted away from her. Sam admired it because he knew how hard it could be with Jordan and Rudra. He remembered the first time they’d hung out in the seventh grade. Their jokes effortlessly embedded into each other. He sat and turned his head back and forth as if he were at a tennis match, unable to speak. 
            </p><p>The hours went by. They were slowly running out of things to make fun of, so they retreated back into their seats. Sam and Jordan shared earphones as they looked out the window at the Moroccan countryside. They watched as the farmland outside continued endlessly, interrupted less and less often by smaller and smaller towns. The van then started to climb, and the farmland slowly turned into rock, and the hills started to block out the horizon. There was no grass and there were no trees, it was a world of rock and dirt. The road twisted and turned with the hills as the ground grew more and more grey. Sam turned back to the bus and realized that his friends had fallen asleep. He took the earphone back from Jordan’s ear and turned to the window again. The van kept ascending. The other van the group had could be seen every now and then behind them before another hill would block it out again. Each time the van appeared Sam looked at it until it disappeared. The sun had started to fall, turning the rocks red, as they eventually grew into mountains. Sam felt like he was on the moon. By the time the van started to descend, the darkness already hung low enough that the world outside was impenetrable.

            <p>Sam and Rudra hung their feet over the side of the roof, seeing who could throw rocks further. They had to guess who was winning as the rocks were disappearing halfway through into the night, but it didn’t matter anyway. Sadie came up the stairs and sat down next to Rudra. They talked about their rooms and about Ms. Williams’s husband, before the conversation drifted away. Sam and Rudra then played their game where they pretended Sadie had said something racist.     
            </p><p>“Stop. I’m serious. Let’s talk about something else”. 
            </p><p>Rudra turned to Sam with a grin and rubbed his chin. “Oh”, he said, “she’s serious. This changes everything.” 
            </p><p>Sam smiled too, “Maybe we just don’t like talking to people who feel that kinda way about Asians”. 
            </p><p>“No, stop. You know that’s not what I said.” Her voice picked up, “you’re not even Asian, Sam”. 
            </p><p>“Oh yeah, you’re right. I completely forgot. I’m not Asian”. 
            </p><p>Rudra laughed, and Sadie pretended to turn away from them. She was good at playing her role, but Rudra was even better. He had a sense of humor that could fit any social situation. Sam felt happy, but he didn’t really feel that he was meant to be there with them. 
            </p><p>Sometime later, the group was called into a dim dining room, split up into tables of four. Large colorful carpets covered the walls. Sam and Jordan sat down next to each other, and Rudra and Sadie moved to sit across from them. “No.” Ms. Williams held Rudra and Sadie back by the shoulder, and then directed the two of them towards the other side of the room. Ms. Williams then sat across from Sam and brought the host, Salah, over to take the other seat across from Jordan. She seemed proud of herself for separating them. Sam and Jordan said nothing, allowing her to have this one. 
            </p><p>Salah, whose house it was they were staying in, explained how to eat the coming dinner. There were no utensils, so they were going to use the bread to wrap up the fish and rice. Salah’s wife, Nahla, with a baby wrapped up on her back, stood up from her seat on the other side of the room and cleared her throat. Everyone stopped talking. She picked up a large teapot, raised it a couple feet above the table, and slowly poured it into a small glass on the table. She smiled as everyone clapped. “Who else wants to try?”. Several kids quickly raised their hands, but Nahla picked Laura, who had sat silently in front of her. 
            </p><p>Laura was shown the technique, and the two of them went around the room in opposite directions, pouring tea in each kid’s glass. Laura reached Sam’s table before Nahla. She poured Ms. Williams’s glass nicely, then turned to Sam. She moved close to him, her leg brushing up against his, her hip by his shoulder. She focused on his glass, slowly pouring it, then looked up when she finished to meet his eyes. Their eyes interlocked tightly, and Sam felt the world fall away from them. She slowly turned and went around the table to the other side. Sam’s eyes followed her, but as he looked down, he realized Ms. Williams was glaring at him. 
            </p><p>Sam and Jordan barely spoke for the rest of the dinner. One wrong word would give her reason to keep a closer eye on them, ruining their plans. Or even worse, she could separate them for the rest of the trip, which she had already threatened back at the airport. Sam fell in and out of the loop of the conversation. He couldn’t stop replaying Laura pouring the tea in his glass and he couldn’t stop himself from glancing at her table. 
            </p><p>“Sam. Are you listening?”. Ms. Williams was staring at him again, and he turned to see Jordan and Salah looking at him too. There would be a goat sacrifice in the morning, and Salah asked if they wanted to see it. They were indifferent, but Ms. Williams seemed excited about it, so they agreed. 
            </p><p>When the dinner ended the four of them walked back together into the boys’ room. It was an empty room except for three cots and a small barred window. Its walls were completely barren. They waited half an hour, then Sam and Jordan got up to check the hallway, which was empty. Sam then went with Jordan to check the side door he had found earlier. They came back into the room to find Sadie and Rudra close to each other on the bed, deep in conversation. 
            </p><p>“Let’s go.” 
        <section>
            <p>They returned sometime later to find the house as empty as it was before. It must have been near midnight. Sam and Jordan went up the roof as Sadie and Rudra had returned to their room together. The night still refused to let them see the mountain, but now Sam felt as if he could see the edges of it somehow. Its tallest point towered over them, and it felt so close to him, its steepness so sharp. He felt the anxiety start to creep in again, but he couldn’t understand why. It seeped into his heart. Suddenly, as he looked up, he could see himself falling. His body was sprawling limb after limb as it plunged down from the sky, twisting every way it could. Its white clothes were startling, surrounded by a black sea that encompassed everything around it. He could feel the wind whistling past its ears and he could see it outlined by the edge of the mountain as it plummeted past it. He quickly looked at Jordan, who he realized was now sprawled out along the floor of the roof, staring up at the sky. He seemed so angry, and he was rubbing his eyes. Sam couldn’t bring himself to look back up. “I’m going to the bathroom dude.” 
            </p><p>Jordan didn’t answer. Sam walked across the roof to the stairs, his heart racing. He went down to go to the second-floor bathroom, the girls floor. The hallway was still empty, with a faint light extended out by a dim lightbulb in the center of the hallway. It had an unspeakable energy to it. The bathroom was a hole in the ground and bucket with a small sink and a mirror. He turned the light on with the chain and looked at his reflection. His hair was all over the place, and he threw water all over himself, feeling his hands twitching as he did it. 
            </p><p>He opened the door to leave, but he stopped. Laura was on her way to the bathroom too. She stopped just as he did. Her eyes caught his again and his mind went blank. She looked at him like she was expecting him, or something like him. The energy from the hallway flowed into his blood. He worried how red his eyes looked underneath the light. Laura’s friend came out of her room too and stared at Sam. He looked back at Laura. She was turned away from him. He walked past them, back up the stairs to the roof, and sat down next to Jordan. 
            </p><p>They didn’t talk. The lights of the rest of the village were still there, but even if they turned to look, they still wouldn’t have been able to see them. The emptiness of the world was just too powerful. A sudden and violent undercurrent of emotion pushed Sam to look back up. His body was falling through the sky again, and his mind suddenly took him back home. 
            </p><p>He and Jordan were driving around in Jordan’s mom’s car. It was late and their friend was laid out in the back seat. Jordan was making turns instinctively, not really paying attention to where there were going. Their high had started to wain off, and everything was getting tiring. Jordan pulled over abruptly onto the side of the street. Sam glanced at him, and then turned off Young Thug. Jordan got out of the car, leaving the door open. Sam closed his eyes for a second, before opening them again. He had no idea where they were. They had to have been somewhere in Maryland because the street signs had changed color. He stared out at the plain and simple houses, which looked back at him silently all in a row. The street was devoid of all movement, and its silence crept in through the open door, pummeling him further into his seat. They didn’t belong here. 
            </p>

            <p>Hours later he and Jordan came back to the room. Sadie had left, and Rudra was stretched out over two of the cots, somehow asleep. Jordan pushed Rudra off, and Rudra woke up and crawled back onto his cot and fell back asleep. Sam got into bed, but he knew he wouldn’t be able to calm down. He turned away from his friends and stared at the wall, as memories and images flew through his mind. He remembered hiking trips with his parents and their friends and their kids who were his age. He remembered the feeling of the leaves underneath his feet as they tried and failed to jump from rock to rock. He could feel the childish energy in their arguments about whether the Nationals would make the playoffs or if there was a way to capture your dreams.
            </p><p>His mind turned towards Laura. He saw himself in her bedroom, she was standing off to the side, looking at him like she did in the Souk. He saw the Beatles posters she had up on her wall behind her. Her window was open, and he could hear the rain falling outside. He saw through the window to the paved backyard, rain pouring down onto it, and past it was the alleyway, and then all of the blue and white rowhouses behind it. He slowly fell asleep. 
            </p>

            <p>The knock on the door woke them up early. Sam and Jordan shuffled out of bed. Jordan tried to shake Rudra awake, but there was no waking him. Nobody else had woken up for the hike but them and Ms. Williams. She seemed surprised but not entirely unhappy. It was still night as they walked up the trail that rose above the village on the other side of the valley from the mountain. The wind wrapped around them, curling them further into their sweatshirts. They climbed until they found themselves on level ground where there was a small area with rocks around it in a circle. They could see bodies of slain goats already hung up by their neck on small trees. A few villagers were talking. Salah went up to the villagers and they talked animatedly.
            </p><p>He turned back to them and motioned them to come closer. They followed his direction, then stood there wordlessly as a villager went over to a goat off to the side and dragged him to the center of the circle. Another man held the goat down, and the original villager pulled out his knife. He cut the goat cleanly across its throat, and blood came gushing out. The man let go of the goat. The goat writhed on the ground for a few seconds, limbs flailing in the air, before finally coming to a rest. Its hind leg gave a jerk here and there. Sam and Jordan looked at each other. It was the first time they had seen something this large die. Its death brought out a wave of overwhelming feeling that forced Sam to turn around. 
            </p><p>He could finally see the mountain in the faint light of morning. It was further away than he had originally thought, but it still towered over the village. His turn made Jordan notice, who then turned with him. It was the Moroccan countryside, with its rude greyness and heartless expanse. It was all too clear how empty the past few days had been. Jordan turned back around to look at Sam. They really had no idea what they were doing with their lives. ❧
