        <section>
            <p>6th Grade: It was a big abandoned school near a national park, with tall white walls and red roofs. There was a sloped grass field following the path next to the school that came along into an open-air cafeteria. There was an open-air gym, too, behind the cafeteria. We arrived in the late morning, spilling out across the grounds like it was our hallways. I remember it most particularly for its sense of openness. The whole place had an emptiness that seemed held back only for a moment by our voices and games. It was dead inside.
            </p><p>It was night and I couldn’t sleep, which wasn’t out of the ordinary for me when I was away from my parents. Every minute passed by, and I gradually felt everyone else in our high-ceilinged room on the fourth floor fall asleep, leaving me alone by myself. Our cots lined the walls of the room all the way around. The windows were open, and I thought I could feel deadness seep through them and flow across the old floors into us.
            </p><p>I shifted out of bed and slowly walked out into the hallway. Moonlight was all I needed to see. Moments later I was in the isolatory cell of the bathrooms. Small white squares with blue sides spread out across the floors and walls, interrupted in some places by glazy mirrors.  The place was eerily quiet, except for some wind. In the dim end of the visibility, I thought I could see an arm, or the flicker of a hand, so I quickly went back to bed.

            <p>7th grade: It was a huge hotel, with rooms as small houses split in two spread out around a hill overlooking a lake. On the other side of the lake was the hotel’s lobby, a roof built with pillars over rows of tables. I remember seeing packs of kids walking around the many different stone paths around the hotel. In the pools by the deserted entrance, kids were chicken fighting in the pools, plain beige earth continuing on past them. I watched interesting people through slits in other people. I shared my room with two of my friends. On the other side of our split house were three boys who we didn’t talk to, but who I knew somewhat from soccer after school. As housemates we shared tours of each other’s rooms, though I was the only one of my friends who went into theirs.
            </p><p>We were all given a choice for what we did during the day. I chose mountain biking, and about thirty or so of us were bussed to the rental place. From there we went into the country, splitting up into groups of ten. I was with some kids I knew, and we were having fun biking down these dirt paths, stranded somewhere out in the Thai countryside. Very soon we couldn’t see any houses anymore, it was just flat green farmland and trees. Dark green mountains were surrounding us in the background. There were some hills in front of us, and we biked into them single file, as if we were fighting in the Pacific theater. Suddenly, my friend Jimmy in front of me lost control and crashed into the side of the path. I came over to help him. So did a girl behind us. He was okay, but his bike was fucked up. I knew how to fix it, so I flipped the bike upside down and ran the chain back onto its spot on the wheel. Then I felt the world start to slow down. At once we all noticed we were the only ones still here. We had been at the back of the line. It was starting to get dark, and thousands of crickets were slowly filing into the atmosphere. She, Louisa, had never talked to me before, but I knew who she was.
            </p><p>“Where did they go?”
            </p><p>“I don’t know.”
            </p><p>I felt around us for a moment. We were lost, obviously. We didn’t speak Thai. I didn’t even know where we were exactly in Thailand. And there were three of us. Jimmy, I liked, we were friends. The other one, this pale girl standing next to me, seemed like someone I could like. Glancing at her face, I suddenly felt the urge to live as just the three of us out here in the wild. We hadn’t grown up around here, and we didn’t know this world. All these plants and birds and crickets were nothing like what we used to know. But we could live here. We got back on our bikes and started to climb up the hill in the direction of the group. When before I was lazy, almost useless, I now felt power rush through my veins.

            <p>At the top, we could see for miles. Grass jungles, with patches of brown and water holes that popped up like little hills. But we couldn’t see anybody. No teacher, no kids. There was a forest to our right, but there was no way they could be there. 
            </p><p>The road in front of us snaked off to the left, if it could be a road. Behind it was an uneven trail that seemed lost to centuries of disuse. Louisa turned to me, my desire to continue straight was now at odds with the clarity of the situation. “Didn’t she say… that we need to turn left here? Or that we can’t continue straight when we get to the turn?”. Our teacher had said nothing of that sort, but still I was gazing happily at her. She was putting herself forward so succinctly. Either Jimmy or I waved it off, and she said nothing more.
            </p><p>I watched casually every little detail. Dark, curly, layered, long hair. Thin, tiny fingers laid out across bicycle metal. The shy and purposeful turns of the head. At once we were alone and in a crowd, together and still separate, brutally. Moments die if we let them. In dreams of her she is dressed all in white.
            </p><p>It lit a fire. We biked down what looked like our path, but we couldn’t be sure. There still wasn’t anybody else in sight. It might soon be over, the collective sort of hold on our momentum, and we would be finding ourselves back in our rooms before we knew it. But we had blood rushing through our veins, telling us the complete opposite. That we were kids completely alone, with only bikes to our names, somewhere out in the middle of rural Thailand.

            <p>That energy which I felt that night in the old dormitory came back later once we’d reached the hotel, as night had started to come in and all the kids had packed themselves together in the lobby. It was open-air of course, and I felt the pressing darkness sweep across the lake into us. Western walls tend to insulate us from the wandering emotions of the outside world. The boys and girls I went to school with were happening all around me, almost too fast for me to fully take in. It was a rare moment of energy for me then. I felt pure excitement talking to people and wandering around the space where all of this was happening. Since being little I’ve been addicted to nonexistence. The eye of the storm. Liminal hesitation. I would stand on the foot of open car doors, waiting almost entire minutes before stepping off, for no real reason. This open-air watering hole was a something new. There are two stages of society, or at least, to playing a part in it. The first is recognizing new human experiences for the value they bring to everyone. Walking around, avoiding pretty girls and annoying classmates, watching people bring their games and friendships into an open play, I had the first. The second, the courage and instinctiveness to become an active player in the game, I couldn’t seem to summon then.
            </p><p>It felt like I was being kept out of a locked apartment for not having a key. I looked around, desperately, for Louisa, or someone like her. I didn’t find her. I never could find her. Just by existing she had the key somewhere in her hair, but only if she also had the patience and quiet approval so that I could stumble over her. I knew then how ridiculous my true feelings were. I retreated into the shadows of the room if there were any. I had some friends, and I talked happily with them, forced too by the clear implication of what I would be if I didn’t.

            <p>Darkness had fully settled in when Mr. McGovern, my science teacher for the year, brought everyone together and had us sit down on the tiled floor. He was clear, calm and confident as he explained that a coup d’état had just occurred back in Bangkok. He told us not to worry and that everything would be okay. I believed him, but still, everyone was silent.
            </p><p>I remembered a month earlier, while teaching us sex education, Mr. McGovern broke down. He explained to us through tears how hard it was to raise four young children, two of them being severely autistic. We were silent, as we were underneath that thatched hotel roof, watching an adult grapple with real life problems in front of our eyes while we still lived in our world where both were absent.
            </p><p>My friends and I returned to our hotel room. I tried to turn on the TV. Instead of the blurry Thai soap opera that had been on before, there was a military insignia, with Thai writing underneath it. I switched the channel and it was the same. They were all the same. I looked at my friends then and they didn’t seem to care at all.
            </p><p>I heard the kids from the other side of the hotel room. Earlier that day they had called me into their room through our shared door. Walking into their bathroom, they guided me into their shower. On the floor next to the drain was a dead frog, its blood and guts everywhere. It held all four of us in silence as we tried to understand it. Now, they were yelling and laughing loudly as if nothing had happened, and as if everything was really the same as it was before.
