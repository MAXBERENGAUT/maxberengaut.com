        <section>
            <p>6th Grade: It was a big abandoned school near a national park, with tall white walls and red roofs. There was a sloped grass field following the path next to the school that came along into an open-air cafeteria. There was an open-air gym, too, behind the cafeteria. We arrived in the late morning, spilling out across the grounds how we would do in our hallways. I remember it most particularly for the sense of openness. The whole place seemed insipidly empty, held back only for the moment by our voices and games. It was dead inside.
            </p><p>At night, I couldn’t sleep, which was not out of the ordinary for me when I was away from my parents. Every minute passed by, and gradually I felt everyone else in my high-ceilinged room on the fourth floor fall asleep, leaving me alone by myself. I lost sense of time. Our cots were lining the walls of the room all the way around. For all I knew it might have been near dawn. The windows were open, and I thought I could feel the deadness seep through them and flow across the old floors into us.
            </p><p>I shifted out of bed and slowly walked out into the hallway. Night light was all I needed to see. I was in the isolatory cell of the bathrooms. Through the windows I could see a slight blue light in the black sky, hidden somewhere near the bottom.  Small white squares with thin blue sides spread out across the floors and walls, interrupted, in some places, with glazy mirrors.  The place was eerily quiet except for some wind. In the dim end of the visibility, I thought I could see an arm, or a flicker of a hand. I went back to my cot.

            <p>7th grade: It was a huge hotel, with rooms as small houses split in two spread out around a hill overlooking a lake. On the other side of the lake was the hotel’s lobby, a roof built with pillars over rows of tables. I was watching packs of kids all across the stone hotel paths. In pools by the deserted entrance, kids were chicken fighting, the plain beige earth continuing on past them. I saw interesting people through slits in other people. I shared my room with two of my friends. On the other side of our split house were three boys who we didn’t talk to, but who I knew somewhat from soccer after school. As housemates we shared tours of each other’s rooms, though I was the only one of my friends who went into theirs.
            </p><p>We were all given a choice for what we would do during the day. I chose mountain biking. About thirty or so of us were bussed to the rental place. From there we went out into the country, splitting into groups of ten. I was with some kids I knew, and we were having fun biking down these dirt paths, stranded somewhere out in the Thai countryside. Very soon we couldn’t see any houses anymore, it was just flat green farmland and trees. Dark green mountains surrounded us in the background. There were some hills in front of us, and we were biking into them single file, as if fighting in the Pacific theater.
            </p><p>Suddenly, my friend Jimmy in front of me lost control and crashed into the side of the path. I came over to help him, and so did a girl behind us. He was okay, but his bike was fucked up. I knew how to fix it, so I flipped the bike upside down and ran the chain back onto its spot on the wheel. Then I felt the world start slowing down. At once we all noticed we were the only ones still here. We had been at the back of the line. It was starting to get dark. Thousands of crickets were slowly filing slowly into the atmosphere. She, Louisa, had never talked to me before, but I knew who she was.
            </p><p>“Where did they go?”, she asked me.
            </p><p>“I don’t know”, I said. 
            </p><p>I felt around us for a moment. We were lost, obviously. We didn’t speak Thai. I didn’t even know exactly where in Thailand we were. And there were three of us. Jimmy, I liked, we were friends. The other one, this pale Swiss girl standing next to me, seemed like someone I could like. Glancing at her face, I suddenly felt the urge to live as just the three of us out here in the wild. We hadn’t grown up around here, and we didn’t know this world. All these plants and birds and crickets were nothing like what we used to know. But we could live here.
            </p><p>I spoke. “Let’s just go straight down the path and hope for the best.” They both stared, challenging me. Her more so. I watched every detail, casually. Dark, curly, layered hair. The thin fingers laid out across bicycle metal. We got back on our bikes eventually and started to climb up the hill in the direction of the group. Louisa was in front. 
            </p><p>I saw somehow, shy purposeful turns in her head. At once we were alone and in a crowd, together and yet still separate, brutally. In dreams of her she’s dressed all in white. When before I was lazy, almost useless, I now felt power rushing through my veins.

            <p>At the top, we could see for miles. Grass jungles, with patches of brown and water holes that popped up like little hills. We couldn’t see anybody. No teacher, no kids. There was a forest to our right, but there was no way they could be there.
            </p><p>The road we’d been following snaked off in front of us to the left down the hill. If you could call it a road. You could see far ahead down it, but our group didn’t seem to be there. Straight ahead was an uneven foot trail that seemed lost to centuries of disuse. Louisa turned to me, my desire to continue straight was now at odds with the clarity of the situation. “Didn’t she say… that we need to turn left here?... Or that we can’t continue straight when we get to the turn?”. Our teacher had said nothing of that sort, but still I gazed happily at her. She put it all forward so succinctly. Either Jimmy or I waved it off, and she said nothing more.

            <p>That energy which I felt that night in the old dormitory came back later once we’d reached the hotel, as night had started to come in and all the kids had packed themselves together in the lobby. It was open-air, of course, and I felt pressing darkness sweep across the lake into us. Western walls tend to insulate us from the wandering emotions of the outside world. The boys and girls I went to school with were happening all around me, almost too fast for me to fully take in. I felt pure excitement talking to people and wandering around the space where all of this was happening. Since I was little I have been addicted to nonexistence. The eye of the storm. Liminal hesitations. I’d stand on the foot of open car doors for no real reason, waiting almost entire minutes before stepping off.
            </p><p>There are two stages in society, or at least, in playing a part in it. The first is recognizing new human experiences for the value they bring to everyone. Walking around, avoiding pretty girls and annoying classmates, watching people bring their games and friendships into open play, I had the first. The second, the courage and instinctiveness to become an active player in the game, I couldn’t seem to summon then. It was like I was being kept out of a locked apartment for not having the key.
            </p><p>I looked around, desperately, for Louisa, or for something like her. I didn’t find her. It could have been something special, or the start of something special. Moments die if we let them. Just by existing she had that key, hidden, somewhere in her hair, but only if she also had the patience so I could stumble over to her. A quiet approval, or a polite disapproval, that depended on what I said. I knew then how ridiculous my true feelings were. I retreated into the room’s shadows. If there were any. I had some friends, and I talked to them, forced too by the clear implication of what I would be if I didn’t.

            <p>Darkness had fully settled in when Mr. McGovern, my science teacher for the year, brought everyone together and had us sit down on the tiled floor. He was clear, calm and confident as he explained a coup d’état had just occurred back in Bangkok. He told us not to worry and that everything would be okay. I believed him, but still, everyone was silent.
            </p><p>I remembered a month earlier, while teaching us sex education, Mr. McGovern broke down. He explained to us through tears how hard it was to raise four young children, two of them being severely autistic. We were silent, as we were underneath that thatched hotel roof, watching an adult grapple with real life problems while we still lived in our world where both were absent.
            </p><p>My friends and I returned to our hotel room. I tried turning on the TV. Instead of the blurry Thai soap opera that had been on before, there was a military insignia, with Thai writing underneath it. I switched the channel and it was the same. They were all the same. I looked at my friends then and they didn’t seem to care at all.
            </p><p>I heard the kids from the other side of the hotel room. Earlier that day when they called me into their room, they had had something to show me. Walking in, they guided me towards their shower. On the floor next to the drain was a dead frog, its blood and guts everywhere. It held all four of us in silence while we tried understanding it. Now, they were yelling and laughing loudly as if nothing had happened, and as if everything was really the same as it was before.
