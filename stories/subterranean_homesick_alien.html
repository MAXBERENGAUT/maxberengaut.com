        <p>It was near the end of high school, and the world, like the snow falling outside her house, was beginning to feel real. She smiled at him as she left her house, nodding down towards her clothes. They were wearing the same shirt. Disappointment had always felt inevitable to him, but still, he let that singular pleasantness tell him that there was something outside his life in her. He had been rejected from every school he’d applied to, and as he had kept postponing telling his parents, it had yet to fully set in. She got into the car, and in the car, they started to talk. 
        </p><p>She was about to commit to art school and liked to imagine with him that it was a matter of life or death. Everything else had to be simple. Her family, they had to understand that she had passed their limited view of her when she was still a child. Her friends, they had to see that there wasn’t anyone else they’d spend time with over her. Her boyfriend, he had to let her feel wanted at all times, especially at school, where she would involve herself completely in the social dynamics, and where it was always necessary to have something you could rely on. So, they were work friends, and though they went to the same school, it was much simpler to talk outside it. 
        </p><p>He would drive them on the freeway with no hands, a fingertip here and there, casually looking at her every so often. He would always act as if he didn’t care about their eyes meeting, as if the seconds weren’t already being stretched into hours in his memories. Lights always tended to come between them whenever they looked at each other, and this one, after some time now on the freeway, was the last stoplight before they turned left into their parking lot. With the car finally free of movement they could finally read their surroundings. Snow was really starting to come down, and the hotel, standing over them and the rest of the freeway, looked out over everything like some kind of archaic spirit. It was ten stories tall, and the bright red name on its roof penetrated all the trees around and could be seen from miles away. 
        </p><p>Freeway cars started to pass by in the lane beside them, rattling their bodies, each successive car bringing with it a wave of energy that felt like starting pistols igniting the earth. At that red light, with her legs spread out across the bottom of his car, he was starting to feel himself being terrorized by the way her features seemed to float against each other as they slid in and out of place. Looking at her then was the hardest thing he had ever done in his life, and it hurt him, all of it did. 
        </p><p>She had nothing on her mind besides what was unavoidably in front of her. The Marriot in snow, burning alive in the grey. Finally, she glanced back at him and found that she could read the seven letters of their hotel reflected back to her in his eyes. Blue eyes. Blue eyes which held the power of becoming blue moments. 
        </p><p>They drove to work together every night from the hills of Mount Oliver to here somewhere outside of Pittsburgh, all because he had asked one night if she had wanted a ride home. That first drive, as he talked endlessly about OK Computer and Alan Faneca, she tried to read something in how he would go on and on. She couldn’t although she always felt she could. He was acting as if they’d known each other for more than a couple of months of the years between them, something outside of their hallways and their break rooms that she had no memory of. There was no way for her to know that it was because he was in love with her. Someone had told him about how she’d met her boyfriend in a jacuzzi at a Seven Springs vacation home. While it let him talk to her at least, as it is always so much easier with something in the way, it was not enough. He imagined for himself a life for them in the staff areas that lie just underneath the surface of hotels, and they built it together, brick by brick. 
        </p><p>White letters on green paint lit up by the lights of their car passed by them. Dark trees and the summer air were ripping through the car windows. They saw the sign for Pittsburgh and moved onto the final road back home. They turned in and out, talking in between the sudden drops of the car, until they came upon the base of the city. Out in front of them were all the industrial city lights, as well as rivers and windows, with people and dogs inside them. They both remembered that night long after it happened. 
        </p><p>Their winter break had started a couple days ago, which clearly meant that the anniversary of that awful day in 1997 must have been close. It hit him every time he thought about her. Each time his hand went near his face, her smell lofted itself from his fingertips to his nostrils, forcing him to grimly swear his undying hatred for every ski resort in the entire world. Outdated chairlifts, icy crowded slopes, mass-produced luxury houses with huge fucking Jacuzzis. They all laughed at him mercilessly and at how his hands tightly griped the steering wheel in response to being unable to control the world and its constant stream of images. 
        </p><p>It became one of those few things that she could notice about him, and which she subsequently kept safe in the back of her mind. She knew, but didn’t know, at least not really, how much she liked not knowing what was going on in his head. All she knew for sure was that she hated exactness and any possibility of there being a static idea of herself. In his car, she would touch her skin just to make sure that she hadn’t become liquid. She opened her mouth, struck by the falling snow and pushed on by his presence and the acceptance letter she knew she had waiting at home. 
        </p><p>“If you think about it, there’s not much of anything everlasting for us. Snow exists for days at a time then vanishes as if it was never there. Every moment we spend out in the snow is a dying movement, our heart already set long before on its eventual demise.” She was looking at him so intensely. “If we stop at this red light for another minute after it turns green, 50 cars will pass us in less than a minute. Every car has in it a life, with every aching moment enshrined in it as much as it is with yours. For that minute, you occupy the same spot, the same air, that same space.”
        </p><p>That night, after being forced into the overnight shift at the hotel during the snowstorm, they were going to have the same dream. There were hardly any guests, only five out of the hundred or so rooms were occupied. By midnight, their work was over, so they hung out with their jokes and little games in a suite on the highest floor. Sitting next to each other on the floor, their backs propped up against the tight white bedsheets, they looked out at the snow falling through the big huge windows. Hours later, on that same bed with the TV and all their clothes still on, they fell asleep, drifting into the same sparse and claustrophobic dream of those hard seconds waiting at the light. The color green felt rough in their vibrating bones, a distant cataclysm, but it had to be, had to exist, had to ruin everything. 
        </p><p>That early morning, as he brought her back to her home and away from him, there were no lights upon the skyline. The dawn had brought a yellowish mist down onto them that filled up the cold blue air. It was to be the last time they’d see it all together, side-by-side, and they reached into each other then, both straining against the tacit rules of friendship, both anticipating the same non-existent future, and as it had only ever really existed in their heads they were not aware that that future was of the moment, of the present and of nothing else but the tall bridges of their hometown. 
        </p><p>“Some things aren’t impermanent. Family, movies, music, close friends, feelings, songs stay entrenched in our minds for years and they’re always there, solidly, for whenever we need them.” 
        </p><p>She was still looking at him, but he was looking out the window instead, as he realized that there were two motorcyclists pulled up in the lane next to them, their outlines only visible because the night’s snow had not yet achieved the thickness it so desperately wanted. They were talking to each other like old friends. It had to have been freezing outside. He turned from them back to her and her face. There was no time, no time to tell her how he felt, no time to watch her fall in love with him. The light flicked on, casting the two of them in golden green, and it was over. ❧
