    "write_up": "Mac Miller, through albums like Blue Side Park, Divine Feminine, and Swimming, proved himself to be a gifted rapper. He never wows at first hearing, but he is always able to fit seamlessly into the beat. On his best songs, he finds pockets of wisdom from the back of his mind, like in Avian, where he quips “TV Money / Dollar for sense of humor” and “Not into this conversation, I been in my head for hours, I’m out.” These lyrics perfectly encapstulate the (drug-related) feeling of wanting to escape our bodies:",

He has never been an artistic innovator, borrowing from other artists and producers for the basis of his sound, but still, he created a distinctive style.

Vonte’s innate stylistic reliance on heavy autotune takes some getting used to, but on songs like ‘On God’, he finds the hidden emotional pathos absent from much of mainstream rap, powered all the time by a brilliant, spectral beat.
