    "write_up": "Future/Young Thug, as the defacto Modest Mouse/Built to Spill of the Atlanta generation of rap music, have made a lot of music together, even an entire project. Sup Mate is my personal favorite, as it shows what happens when geniuses are given the space to interplay artistically with each other. So much of it feels almost ridiculously instinctual. Anyone who knows their musical style can tell it isn’t an act. There are so many great throw away lines here, sticky lines, like fish guts, that make ‘Sup Mate’ an alive work of art. It's the type of song to make a sleepless bus drive from Sevilla to Valencia in the middle of the night somehow worthwhile.",

I was in 5th grade when a girl caught me looking at her, and as she looked away and rolled her eyes, I heard perfectly that tune of ‘I want to make you happy’ repeating somewhere deep inside me. A year or two later, standing in my room, looking out the window over a foreign city, I listened to it again so I could be transported back, skin and soul and all, to my hometown.

It’s not really that surprising when you think about it. Different people, different strokes. Gentleman is one of the only songs that transcends that barrier. The personality and the unexpected skill here, all invented from the mind of a ski masked 15-year-old, were enough for me back in the day. It has grown a lot in popularity in recent years, but even in 2017, the artistic difference was there for everyone to see.",

'Nature metaphors come so readily to mind when listening to shoegaze—clouds, stars, skies, storms, oceans, whirlwinds, maelstroms—that it’s easy to believe that, like the weather it evokes, it just sort of happens. Invest in the right guitar pedals, put the right breathy spin on your vocals, and bam—instant Loveless, or close enough to fool a stoned and heartsick teenager. It’s as easy as walking out your front door and letting the spring air greet you. For some bands that may well be all there is to it. But song by song, moment by moment, sometimes even note by note, Slowdive do it better. There’s nothing elaborate in the bassline for Slomo, the opening track of their first album in 22 years, given the thick bed of guitars it bounces on. Just seven notes, the sixth of which leaps unexpectedly up an octave instead of continuing the bassline’s descent. Or at the end of 'Slomo,' when Rachel Goswell’s voice pulls off a similar trick, first when she takes over lead vocals from Neil Halstead, then when she starts singing them at the very top of her register… all it takes are these small but striking detours to remind us that this glorious noise is the work of human hands and the skill that move them.'",

In some of the most psychedelically active production I’ve ever heard, three non A$AP Rocky members of the A$AP Mob so adequately summarize the racial mess of the American social ecosystem that I feel anything more direct would miss the point entirely. It’s the best song off the two classic Cozy Tapes, with A$AP Ferg delivering an all-time final verse.",

    "write_up": "At the end of the day, music is about pathos, and pop music is about sexy pathos. The dark, thudding bass lines, the annoying-ass record scratch, the slowly building synths, all of that is what makes the sad content of this song ‘sexy’. Everything thing else is pure human emotion, Bon Iver’s part (“I heard you need a new, phone!”), Chief Keef’s part (“these bitches can’t handle me!”), Kanye’s unforgettable verse (“Okay I smashed your corolla!”), and of course, that Mike Dean guitar. Yeezus was Kanye’s greatest album, his best representation of his organizational genius, and Hold My Liquor, as the perfect example of all those facts, was the decade’s greatest song.",
