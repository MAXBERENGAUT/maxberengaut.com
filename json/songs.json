    "write_up": "Future/Young Thug, as the defacto Modest Mouse/Built to Spill of the Atlanta generation of rap music, have made a lot of music together, even an entire project. Sup Mate is my personal favorite, as it shows what happens when geniuses are given the space to interplay artistically with each other. They must have been off their ass when they made it, so much of it feels almost ridiculously instinctual, which of course anyone who knows their musical style can tell isn’t an act. There are so many great throw away lines here, sticky like fish guts, that make ‘Sup Mate’ an alive work of art which can make a sleepless bus drive from Sevilla to Valencia in the middle of the night somehow worthwhile. The secret is having someone to think about.",

Similar to their more recent songs like ‘Whole Lotta Nothing’ and ‘Crossing Over’, ‘Pilot Light’ attacks human sensation with a riotous desire to understand. The song’s subject matter is actually strikingly similar to ‘Breakthrough’ off of ‘This Is a Long Drive for Someone With Nothing to Think About’. Maybe it’s that band I first had in mind.",

I was in 5th grade when Julia Arnsberger caught me looking at her, and as she quickly looked away and annoyedly rolled her eyes, I heard perfectly that tune of ‘I want to make you happy’ repeating somewhere deep inside me. A year or two later, standing in my room, looking out the window over a foreign city, I listened to it again so I could be transported back, skin and soul and all, to my hometown.
