  "write_up": "Young Thug and Future by this point in 2022 have more or less abandoned their uniqueness in the attempt to secure hits like Lil Baby and Lil Durk have been able to get. While some see this is as an example of their waning influence as artists, the existence of underground rappers like BoofPaxkMooky show it to be more just a sign of the times. The same indelible taste for sonically exploratory trap music lives on, only this time, it\u2019s people with the urge to do something new. BoofPaxk\u2019s hiccupy style takes some getting used to, but eventually his spatial talent wins you over, just like those old guys used too.",
