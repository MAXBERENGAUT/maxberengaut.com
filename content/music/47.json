  "write_up": "Alex G\u2019s unique sensibility for indie rock has made him one of the most ubiquitous names in the \u2018in-the-know\u2019 conversation of who\u2019s actually worth listening to. My favorite album, \u2018Race\u2019, same as the song, rocks back and forth like a cradle, approaching its hooks with sophisticated patience, deploying the cracks in his voice and lyrical pointedness to the fullest extent of their artistic utility.",
  "lyric": "\u2018cause you\u2019re a joke, yeah, you\u2019re a hoax / and now I found you out",
