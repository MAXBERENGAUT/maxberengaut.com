  "year": "2015",
  "write_up": "The lead singer of Forth Wanderers, Ava Trilling, had a bad experience in love, and wisely (or unwisely) chose to let it all out in her band\u2019s music. She specializes in an intimate form of lyrics that trace beautifully over real and complicated human relationships like it\u2019s a conversation on her favorite cereal brands. She is unforgettable, as is the rest of the band.",
  "lyric": "I\u2019ve got some more ideas / You\u2019ll be at home in your room | (Please regret not having me for the rest of your life)",
