  "write_up": "Ezra Koenig is straight, but he still can narrate the perspective of a young man entering a gay love affair as if it\u2019s all he ever knew. The end result is one of the best songs ever, the third best song of the decade, a wandering and poetic treatise on young love and beach houses that never treats its subject matter as anything but the most essential thing on earth. Cowriter Rostam Batmanglij is gay, but I\u2019d like to think people can appreciate homoeroticism without wasting time bothering about the actual sexuality of the artists themselves. Listening to Diplomat\u2019s Son is to experience the sum total of Vampire Weekend\u2019s combined love for African Pop and Singer/Songwriter literary detail, a warm and constantly changing environment like how I\u2019d imagine a submerged dance in the fish filled Red Sea would seem.",
  "lyric": "On a night / When the moon glows yellow in the riptide / With the light / From the TVs buzzing in the house",
