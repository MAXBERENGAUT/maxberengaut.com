  "write_up": "Teen Suicide, aptly named, base their sound on the rediscovery of adolescent emotions. The aesthetic for the music, as it is with most of Sam Ray\u2019s music, is this particular form of specific lo-fi which warps the idea of lo-fi so entirely that it feels like he\u2019s the only person who\u2019s ever thought of making music this way. The sleepy sleekness of the synths and the soft-spoken hushed vocals combine to make it all, and by all I mean life and the song and the world, feel like sitting next to a warm fire.",
