  "year": "2015",
  "write_up": "Future has a reputation for toxicity, as seen by the countless meme accounts using his paparazzi photos as profile pictures, reoptimizing his feelings about masculinity to score meaningless internet points, balkanizing his art down until it\u2019s nothing but ratios. At his best, Future beautifully utilizes those feelings in open space in order to fully understand them. What does it say, when the most vulnerable, most depressed, most whole-heartedly honest any male artist has been in the past decade has to be preempted with a two and a half minute treatise on disposable sex with disposable women?",
