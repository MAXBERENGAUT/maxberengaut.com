  "year": "2017",
  "write_up": "The first three songs of \u2018May God Bless Your Hustle\u2019 should play in the sky for everyone when they enter into New York. It\u2019s hard to name any music that comes close to the transportive powers of their atmosphere. MIKE is a rapper who is a part of the underground, in the sense that a lot of people who love rap music love him, but his style feels separate from both Earl Sweatshirt and early 2000s Kanye beats, even though you can still see the connective tissue between them. It\u2019s unique in its powerless vision, its resignation, and in its powerful repressed joy.",
