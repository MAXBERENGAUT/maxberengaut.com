  "write_up": "I haven\u2019t said anything about music videos for any other song on this list. Oblivion, for all of its merits as a song, would in my opinion be much less without its video. Grimes just sort of dances, as a monster truck event and American football game continue on in the background. Oblivion was written, almost dreamily, about violent male assault, but the video is surprisingly naturalistic, showing that despite its otherworldly qualities \u2018Oblivion\u2019 is very much rooted in the human world. The fact that she makes all of these sounds herself is incredible, and her special voice has a fluttering quality that she had already mastered, but which now she took to its fullest potential.",
