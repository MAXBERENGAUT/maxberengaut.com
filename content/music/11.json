  "write_up": "Before I got into Young Thug, Uzi was in charge of my music taste, functioning as both the warmth of my hometown and the love of human feeling. Uzi will always have a talent for unique song construction, with melodies effortlessly cascading over each other, and here it comes about as close as you can to perfection. The synths near the end are brilliant.",
