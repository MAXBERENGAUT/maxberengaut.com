  "write_up": "Under the influence of legendary A&R A$AP Yams, A$AP Mob pushed New York City back into the spotlight as the epicenter of rap music, and nobody was more important for that move than Rocky. Weed was back, and stoner swag became cool again (I know, about Lil Wayne). It started with the initial stylistic innovations of limited musicians like SmokeGhostPurpp and Lil B, but A$AP Rocky and the rest of the Mob turned that style into era defining music that was both more current and more irresistible.",
