  "write_up": "A lot of people get the wrong idea about Beach House. They only take the obvious scene setting aspects of the music, the stuff that bands like Cigarettes After Sex show isn\u2019t particularly difficult, and conclude there isn\u2019t really anything special about it. What they miss most is the songwriting, not really in the lyrics per se, but in how those hard fought lyrics and beautiful guitar riffs combine, what musical moments are created in light of those combinations, and in their finalizing vision of it all. That\u2019s their superpower really, their artistic vision, it\u2019s that that really powers the trailblazing path in music they have taken over their career.",
