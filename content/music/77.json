  "write_up": "People really don\u2019t like well-off kids. It makes sense. You\u2019re born with nothing; they\u2019re born with everything. They didn\u2019t have to work for it. The injustice of it all just boils up in your stomach. For many people the last people they\u2019d ever want to feel empathy for are rich kids with problems. That\u2019s why it\u2019s special to hear something that gently prods you in the other direction. Both Frank Ocean and Earl Sweatshirt are at their best here, especially Earl, whose verse is stunningly perfect and passionately descriptive.",
