  "write_up": "Personally I\u2019ve come to find what I like more than anything else with music is the feeling that I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere else. Only Kilo Kish, at least to my knowledge, has found a personal pathway to making indie pop with the cloudy production style of left-field rap music, or at least only she has created an album full of it. She has an endearing and loving personality that comes through sweetly.",
  "lyric": "So hard to breathe and think of you / At the same time / Keep scrolling still my mind ain\u2019t shutting off / like I remember last night",
  "song": "Thoughts on Love and Work",
