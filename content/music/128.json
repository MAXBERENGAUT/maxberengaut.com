  "write_up": "For many artists on this list, I\u2019ve avoided their most famous songs, it\u2019s partly egotistical but it\u2019s really just a matter of what clicks. Car Seat Headrest has many great songs (Nervous Young Inhumans, Something Soon), but none quite like Drunk Drivers. It\u2019s rare, almost impossible to state how rare, to find a song so melodically unforgettable and lyrically perfect that Isaac Brock could have written it.",
  "lyric": "In the backseat of my heart / Our love tells me I\u2019m a mess",
  "song": "Drunk Drivers / Killer Whales",
