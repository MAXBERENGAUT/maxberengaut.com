  "write_up": "Cellophane has FKA Twig\u2019s voice at the center of it like a rock, a crying and lonely rock, but still a quietly brave one. I can\u2019t imagine ever getting my voice as high as she gets it here. Break ups are really hard. The lyrics make it seem like her pain is the world\u2019s pain too, something that I think is both every jilted lover\u2019s dream and also something that is extremely difficult to pull off.",
