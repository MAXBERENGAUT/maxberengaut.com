  "write_up": "From the ridiculous exclusion from streaming services to the stylized title, \u2018NuYork Nights\u2019 is a song made for music fans. Uzi has an innate emotional taste that separates the truly different from the great, and it\u2019s never been more clear than it was here. It\u2019s a song that Pitchfork in another era would have no drawbacks upon labeling a 'stunner'.",
