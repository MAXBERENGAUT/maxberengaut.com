  "write_up": "Eyesore\u2019 is just enthused with spirit, as is almost all of Women\u2019s work, and we are all the better for it. It\u2019s a small market, somewhat inaccessible indie rock, but they approach it with the passion and creativity that makes it extremely worthwhile to listen too. All the good indie rock bands have something specific about them; for Women, it\u2019s an Interpol-like industrial aesthetic mixed wonderfully with the whiny and indiscernible yet still melodic singing of Patrick Flegel.",
