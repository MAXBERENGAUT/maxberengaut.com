  "write_up": "Everyone\u2019s heard a Radiohead song. Some part of their aura will always seem above all other earthly indie bands, but the 2010s saw the first decade of indie music where Radiohead was not a major player. \u2018Identikit\u2019, and \u2018A Moon Shaped Pool\u2019 in general, suggest though that the core songwriters could continue to make great music for the foreseeable future (The Smile). \u2018Identikit\u2019s guitars meander through shifting backgrounds of soft choruses that rise and fall to produce a surprisingly ear-wormy final product.",
