  "write_up": "I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be without Vampire Weekend. Without Contra and their self-titled album I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019d be interested in music. I remember in middle school believing sullenly that I couldn\u2019t realistically be in a relationship with anyone who didn\u2019t also love Vampire Weekend too. Giving Up The Gun has the sort of pop skill and lyrical depth that, when I was twelve years old I thought every musical act had, and with disappointment I found out not every band had lyrical genius pages which felt like little CliffsNotes for great works of literature. Ezra Koenig and the rest of the band have a special gift for incredibly passionate music.",
