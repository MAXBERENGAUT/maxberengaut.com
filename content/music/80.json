  "write_up": "Rolling Blackouts remind me somehow of working in a newspaper. I guess it\u2019s the title of the song, but I feel like I had that urge before I\u2019d even got to this particular (great) EP. Adult life feels warmly acceptable in their hands, and I can\u2019t imagine anything more adult life like than working in a newspaper. It\u2019s \u2018dad\u2019 rock without ever becoming boring or too predictable. Fun, even.",
  "lyric": "I\u2019m alright if you ask me, but you never do",
