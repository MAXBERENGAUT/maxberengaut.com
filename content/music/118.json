  "write_up": "Courtney writes this song for someone who she doesn\u2019t like very much, who she might even hate, but okay, she likes them enough, she admits, to jack off to their songs in order to fall asleep. For one, it\u2019s an unexpected and personal revelation, but it\u2019s also delivered in her off-hand nonchalant way, which makes it catchy, extremely memorable, and a damn good song.",
