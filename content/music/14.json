  "write_up": "As Young Thug grew as an artist, he began to grow-up production wise, onto the type of beats only world class artists have access too. Daddy\u2019s Birthday, recorded at an unknown date but released in 2017\u2019s \u2018Beautiful Thugger Girls\u2019, is one of the many examples for why we are lucky for that to have been possible. The innovative approach to song structure and ad-libs, the easy-going ear for melody, and best of all the instinctive ability to stay in step with the beat make songs like \u2018Daddy\u2019s Birthday\u2019 rare. It\u2019s written by an introspective Thug, willing and able to unleash his artistic vision into the world.",
