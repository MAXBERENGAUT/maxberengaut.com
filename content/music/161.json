  "write_up": "After You is the only leak on this list. I wouldn\u2019t have included it, first-draft mumbled verses and all, if I didn\u2019t still think it was a finished artistic product in a way. He can reinterpret this again if he wants but I don\u2019t even know if it would still have the same sort of emotional power he gets across here from freestyling. Sometimes, when the productions perfect, talented artists can catch something real from somewhere inside you as you invent on the spot. Being alone with yourself and your voice and your thoughts is enough.",
