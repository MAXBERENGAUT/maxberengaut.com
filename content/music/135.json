  "write_up": "I first heard Bladee through my friend\u2019s speaker, standing in a park, smoking and laughing together, while synths entered into my soul. We all liked Bladee, which is unique, because there was hardly anybody who we all really liked. His best songs are like alien deposits, little packets of emotion and newfound auditory pleasure mixed together into something somehow coherent. It was new, innovative, and ridiculously creative.",
