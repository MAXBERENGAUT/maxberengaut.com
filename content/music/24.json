  "write_up": "Alvvays aren\u2019t supposed to be this good. At the end of the day they\u2019re just rehashing the music indie rock bands in the 80s made, and they don\u2019t even have their eyes on grand artistic statements. They\u2019re not the 1975, and they're not One Direction either. What they\u2019ve done instead is make the sort of pop music that would be great in any generation. \u2018Ones Who Love You\u2019 is slow, heavy, and wonderfully lost in space. It\u2019s the kind of thing built for people who like listening to music.",
