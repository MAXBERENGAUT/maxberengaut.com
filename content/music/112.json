  "write_up": "I won\u2019t write much about this song. I think a lot of it speaks for itself. The high pitched autotune in the background is genius, as is his standard sense for how to let the beat breathe and speak for itself, all so when he comes on it\u2019s more special. This particular style of song has more or less dominated the last couple years of SoundCloud rap, and it\u2019s not hard to see why.",
