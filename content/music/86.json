  "write_up": "One of the best albums of the decade, \u2018Tha Tour Pt. 1\u2019, is a prime example of what can happen when artistic collaboration is managed properly. The talents of both the artists, of which Young Thug\u2019s goes without saying, and which Rich Homie Quan\u2019s surprisingly matches, grow into something never before been heard. Instead of the collaboration limiting their power, it makes it more awe-inspiring, like a fading shooting star. The aesthetics of this album are peppered into almost every mainstream and underground trap project of the past five or so years.",
