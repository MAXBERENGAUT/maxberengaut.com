  "write_up": "Throughout the decade Michele Zauner built Japanese Breakfast single-handedly into a well-regarded mainstream indie pop act.  Many songs could have been on this list, but \u2018Rugged Country\u2019 is one of her most isolatorily brilliant pop songs. Seemingly about dating a friend\u2019s ex despite its morbid imagery, her pain and emotional clarity pass perfectly through her vocals, with her guitars behind her, one step at a time.",
