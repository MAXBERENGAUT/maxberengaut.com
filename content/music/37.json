  "write_up": "The best movie of the century has the greatest score of the century, a soaring technical masterwork of synthesizers and pulsing bass lines. Complication is one of the songs on the album that most underscores the rapidly enlarging sense of global anxiety that\u2019s being depicted dramatically. The roaring synth line about halfway through brings with it an inescapable doom, an attachment to chaos, and a cry for help, all at once. What\u2019s even more incredible is that they did it about 15 or 16 more times over the course of the album/film.",
