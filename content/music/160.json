  "year": "2015",
  "write_up": "Hop Along have released three great albums this decade, but my personal favorite is 'Painted Shut', which glows from song to song, hook to hook, until the songs are indistinguishable from each other yet still clearly separate when you actually listen to one of them. The backing band is not especially important here, instead it\u2019s the up-and-down, quiet-and-loud, constant contradictions of Quinlan\u2019s Midwestern and uniquely Emo singing style that make it so good.",
