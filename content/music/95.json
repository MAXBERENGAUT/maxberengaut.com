  "write_up": "$uicideboy$ have made their mark off of reinterpreting late 90\u2019s Memphis stoned gangster rap. Sometimes they can be reduced down into pastiche, but there are very often times when they actually do build off of it into something new, like this EP, which over three songs illuminates a particular talent for production and quick, deadly, hooks that seamlessly seep into our headspace through their familial sonic chemistry.",
  "lyric": "(My) Weakness seems to be that I cannot stop breathing",
  "song": "My Flaws Burn Through My Skin Like Demonic Flames From Hell",
