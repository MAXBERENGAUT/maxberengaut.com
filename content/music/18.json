  "write_up": "It took me a while to come to my first conception of pop music. I used to think it was the stuff on the Top 40 radio stations, like Taylor Swift, or those famous 80s singers I\u2019d never really listened too. As a kid I moved away from it, as a result, into so-called alternative and indie music, to find something that I could convince myself of not having some commercial purpose. It is with trap music and with indie bands like Wild Nothing that I\u2019ve come to understand every song I\u2019ve ever liked has been pop music. Bored Games is wistful, apologetic, and wonderful to listen too. It\u2019s Indie Pop at its best.",
