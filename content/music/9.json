  "write_up": "Frances Quinlan specializes in a herky-jerky song structure, that uses her gifted voice and her lyrical talent to cover over the hooks and contours so they become indistinguishable from the song itself, the final goal of all music. And all art too, to a degree. I\u2019ve never seen an artist more unabashedly purposeful in the use of childhood as a well for artistic ingenuity.",
