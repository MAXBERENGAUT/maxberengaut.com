  "write_up": "A lot of people like the subjective idea of ballads, just like people like the subjective idea of musicals, as packets of wonderful and protracted human emotion. I\u2019ve never been the type; I prefer hooks and catchiness more than I like the good-natured giddiness of movies like \u2018Mamma Mia\u2019. On the Sea is the only time I\u2019ve felt that I could really share that joy. It is plainly a legendary and canonical epic of feeling, a song that only really exists so listeners can soak in it, over and over.",
