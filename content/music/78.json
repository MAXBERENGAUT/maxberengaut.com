  "write_up": "This song has the longest hook ever, it\u2019s awesome. Young Nudy is so cool. Every song he makes is fun, but his best songs are like crowded rally car races, exciting and dangerous, surprising and hidden, just so easy to consume again. His quiet soft-spoken style is a little off-putting, but once it clicks, it somehow makes his threats and violent recollections feel all the more visceral. That visceral thing is what a lot of mediocre rap music just doesn\u2019t have.",
