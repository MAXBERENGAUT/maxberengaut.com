  "write_up": "The guitars and atmosphere of Ulrika Spacek are hard to resist, though admittedly borrowing something from Deerhunter. The vocals of Mimi Pretend don\u2019t come in until 2:00 minutes in, and when they do, they fucking kill it, as the wonderful tension erupts into a searing chorus and one of the best vocal melodies of the decade. Complex, elegant, indecipherable, and unforgettable.",
