  "write_up": "LCD Soundsystem isn\u2019t known for pop-gold through brevity, they find it instead through elongated philosophical meanderings, surrounded by straight-forward dance-influenced bass and drum lines, as well as small guitar licks. Home isn\u2019t \u2018All My Friends\u2019, or \u2018Someone Great\u2019, but it finds a soft transcendence through reimagining the basics that made up those two gargantuan songs. Every component fits perfectly.",
  "lyric": "And you stay home, and you better, \u2018cause you\u2019re afraid of what you are",
