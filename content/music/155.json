  "write_up": "Arbes make vibey music for the sake of making vibey music. True, a lot of other bands do that. I can name a few who made it big off of Spotify in the last couple years. Their artistic sensibility is stronger than those acts though, even if they don\u2019t have the numbers to show for it. Vibes here exist in the sophisticated distance, able to be enjoyed but never to feel in excess. The beach guitars are a nice change too for this style of music.",
