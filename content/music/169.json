  "write_up": "Jay Som is another piece of evidence for queer women's indie rock takeover. Peach Boy is a standout track for her as a result of its earworm nature. I really like the main guitar riff, prodding and well thought-out, and its specific hazy tone combines nicely with her lo-fi vocal track. It\u2019s just a well written song, loving and repentful, never having to take itself too seriously.",
