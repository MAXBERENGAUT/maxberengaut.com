  "write_up": "I like this song a lot, not for its extremely cool relatable lead singer, or its guitars which come together perfectly at the exact right time, every time, but because it is bursting with life, begging to be loved and appreciated as something almost abstract, outside of the limitations of the 1:58 mp3 file. The song has a stunning lyrical momentum.",
