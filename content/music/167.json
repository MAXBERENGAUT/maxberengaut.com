  "write_up": "This girl is not happy, like, at all!! Emotion's has never come so easily for a band this century. Ava Trilling, as well as Ben Guterl, were genius high schoolers overflowing with talent. That age thing doesn't really affect the quality of the music. \u2018Paws\u2019 seems written about a close teen friendship turning unhappily into romantic love. However, what really makes Forth Wanderers different, is that when I played this on my radio show the old man who ran a 70s station the hour before me called me up, begging to know the name of the band and the name of this song. Some people can just create things that go beyond the limits of their experience.",
