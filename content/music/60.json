  "write_up": "Kodak Black is one of those guys who you wouldn\u2019t want to have dinner with. Like ever. Nevertheless, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a more instinctively gifted musical artist this decade. In his extensive catalogue, he has song after song glittering in the sun of his impeccable flow, his perfect intonation, his sense for how to be himself. \u2018Skrt\u2019, one of his first big songs, is slow when other artists would be fast, steady when others would be energetic. Talent in other words.",
