  "write_up": "Fox Academy made some of the best bedroom pop of the era (Lavender Blood) by not trying to necessarily make music with that kind of label. Their best songs are about isolation, but always indirectly, even as the lyrics describe an elongated lonely stay in a hospital, it\u2019s the hazy edges of the production that really reinforce those well-known inspirational feelings of alienation. Property Brothers never felt more nihilistic, which says something.",
