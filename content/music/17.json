  "write_up": "Adrianne Lenker confronts trauma head first, her piercing eye and limitless heart bringing out the sullen truth of it all, unblinkingly. The prose here is unexpectedly wonderful, a painful slice of family life like something Alice Munro would write, but with the melodic instinct and sensibility for indie rock that makes for special music.",
  "lyric": "Sister came out and put her arms around me / Blood gushing from my head / You held me in the backseat with a dishrag / Soaking up blood with your eye.",
