  "write_up": "Before anyone uses this song in their movie, let me do it first. I know exactly how to make it come to life on screen. I\u2019ve got it all mapped out in my head, shot for shot, moment for moment, dramatic purpose for dramatic purpose. It would be a killer moment in cinema if I could do it. Anyway, Melody is amazing, and her voice and the synths here are like heaven on earth. Kevin Parker likely played a key role too.",
