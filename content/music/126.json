  "write_up": "What makes life feel amazing, really? Sex, money, recognition, and music. Q Da Fool, the classic DC rapper, finds happiness, or at least models a version of it while he breezes through the streets and euphoric background synths. Just flat out works well, similarly to Trap Flue\u2019s \u2018Couple Bandz\u2019.",
