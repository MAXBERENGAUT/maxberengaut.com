  "write_up": "Danny Brown has the voice of an angel. Maybe not the most sober angel, but an angel, nonetheless. His off-the-wall delivery style hides a meticulous writer\u2019s instinct, checking syllables and meanings within a hyena-like voice that makes no sense really (could he even put into words what he\u2019s going for?), but it works, and there\u2019s no one else like him.",
