  "write_up": "While Thaiboy Digital and Ecco2k have cloud rap reputations that speak for themselves, I still wonder what would happen if these beats landed in other people\u2019s hands. It\u2019s some of the most euphoric production that has probably ever existed, and while Ecco2k especially can float over it with the pathos Drain Gang first became famous for, I wonder what sort of potentially more lyrically potent music this style could help create over the next decade.",
