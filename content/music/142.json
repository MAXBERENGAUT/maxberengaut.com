  "write_up": "STRFKR are one of the happiest, most bountifully creative groups of the decade. They\u2019re not particularly substantive, but they have a knack for melodies, which come through the emotionally searing vocals and electronic peripheries of \u2018Say to You\u2019. Emotions ae hard to come by in our current day and age. STRFKR lets you arrive to them without any overly-sentimental baggage.",
