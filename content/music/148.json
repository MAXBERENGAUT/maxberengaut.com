  "write_up": "Travis Scott has built himself a formidable popular legacy over the course of the decade. He has never been an artistic innovator, borrowing from other artists and producers for the basis of his sound, but still, he created a distinctive style. His lyrics have never been strong, but his syrupy robotic vocals here soar through the bridges and at the end of the day, he comes close to Young Thug\u2019s world, which is a credit to him, considering it\u2019s his song.",
  "lyric": "I\u2019m it like a game that get played by a kid",
  "song": "Skyfall (ft. Young Thug)",
