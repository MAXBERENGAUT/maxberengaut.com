  "write_up": "I wouldn\u2019t really say that IDK is a fantastic rapper. A lot of the music he makes is fake tough-guy stuff, searching for pop music success without the obvious internet sensation type buzz that precedes any real success. But this song, this song is utterly fantastic. He traces over a failing mom-son relationship with the sort of unfiltered emotional precision that many musicians spend their whole life trying to find. He describes the pipeline from home-life problems into bullying issues into a life your family hates like it\u2019s the entire world, which of course, it is.",
  "lyric": "Bumping in my headphones, on the way to school on a school bus / Where the cool ones usually the act a fool ones / And the new ones, usually the ones they pick on / That was me, the whole class use to laugh at me... (It is difficult for me to reach my mom's expectations of me, and it makes me feel bad about myself)",
  "song": "No Shoes On The Rug, Leave Them At The Door",
