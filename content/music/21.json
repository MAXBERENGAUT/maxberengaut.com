  "write_up": "Snail Mail is the quintessential indie act of this decade. Lindsey Jordan was a 16-year-old girl from the suburbs of Baltimore when she released this first project, probably her best, and she had only known that world. It is the power of indie music that allows geniuses to extend past their theoretical limits, like no other genre on earth. Even prodigies like Chief Keef had to use older producers for their beats. Snail Mail did the guitars and vocals and every little detail all on her own.",
