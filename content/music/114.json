  "write_up": "Helvetia has been a quiet well for quality indie rock for some time now, and part of it is in the distinctiveness of the music. He has a particular brand of hushed sad boy vocals that just fits well with the mess of wheeling guitars. I will always admire men who sing openly about jealousy, as it\u2019s one of those things that the wrong sort of person will see as masculine weakness, and it\u2019s scary to find out whether or not someone archaically believes in sexualized men",
