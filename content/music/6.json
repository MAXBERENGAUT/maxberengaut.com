  "write_up": "The first song on his legendary 2016 project \u2018Blonde\u2019 is stunningly poetic. The almost exaggeratedly simple drum pattern allows Mr. Ocean to really make up the difference over both sections of this song split in half by the absence or existence of a high-pitched vocal filter. The split halves feel like a direct start to the album\u2019s titular obsession with duality, and of course, bisexuality.",
  "lyric": "Said she need a ring like Carmelo / You must be on that white like Othello",
