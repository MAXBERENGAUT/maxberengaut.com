  "write_up": "Yung Gleesh is, to borrow from Youtube comment sections, a rapper\u2019s rapper. For an outsider to trap music, Yung Gleesh seems quasi-talentless, and it\u2019s hard to really describe what makes him special. I think it might be mostly centered in his reckless endearing confidence, his beat selection, and his unique whispery delivery style that is quietly all about melody. \u2018Trappin\u2019 Benny\u2019 is just a nice song about his talented producer, Trapmoney Benny, but at the same time, it\u2019s a subtle musical innovation, and that\u2019s why even without any hits people know his name.",
