  "write_up": "While their most important music is in their first three projects, the Sea and Cake are one of the most consistently creative indie bands for a reason. Harps starts off at a snail\u2019s pace, but it provides the room for one stunningly clean guitar crescendo. Like their 1997 slow-build epic, \u2018The Argument\u2019, the Sea and Cake defy the familiar trappings of indie pop by hiding their gold from sight at first glance. ",
