  "write_up": "This song is the only song on this list that has been placed for sentimental purposes. All the rest I honestly believe to be the best songs of the decade. Not that I'm going to like argue with someone who thinks \u2018Junk of the Heart\u2019 was that great, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s only on this list because no other song has been as singularly important in my passion for music. I was in 5th grade when a girl caught me looking at her, and as she looked away and rolled her eyes, I heard perfectly that tune of \u2018I want to make you happy\u2019 repeating somewhere deep inside me. A year or two later, standing in my room, looking out the window over a foreign city, I listened to it again so I could be transported back, skin and soul and all, to my hometown. I made sure to only listen to it once and a while, so the feeling would last. It was like time travel. And yeah I guess, it\u2019s also just a great song.",
