  "write_up": "The veering synth in the background, her wonderful sadness, and a simultaneous energy, of a band that knows what it wants. Pop. Empath specialize in vaguely antique guitar textures, but it would be in bad faith to pretend that\u2019s all they are. Their best songs, like soft shape, are encapsulations of rapidly vanishing wistfulness.",
