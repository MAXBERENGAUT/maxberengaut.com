  "write_up": "Mitski is an extremely talented artist who breaks down human nature effortlessly. \u2018I Bet On Losing Dogs\u2019 takes a unique approach to the human tendency to willfully choose the wrong sort of romantic partner, in that it portrays it ashamedly and not as some liberating act of modern independence. It understands the core of its sexual desire, the tacit self-hatred, and the hopelessness of its benefits.",
