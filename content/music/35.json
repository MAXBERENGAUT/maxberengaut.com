  "write_up": "I\u2019ve avoided social activism on this article. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worthwhile, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily artistically worthwhile. It\u2019s songs like Young Ni**a Living that make me most sure of that somewhat anachronistic sentiment. In some of the most psychedelically active production I\u2019ve ever heard, three non A$AP Rocky members of the A$AP Mob so adequately summarize the racial mess of the American social ecosystem that I feel anything more direct would miss the point entirely. It\u2019s the best song off the two classic Cozy Tapes, with A$AP Ferg delivering an all-time final verse.",
  "lyric": "I can\u2019t take this world, ain\u2019t got the patience / Years of oppressions, I\u2019m feeling violated / And that\u2019s why my n***** be highly sedated / Addicted to money, and driving new rangers / Going off the lean, wanna stay faded / They can\u2019t even drink \u2018cause their life is so jaded / I wanna be clean but the water\u2019s so tainted / Ain\u2019t it?",
