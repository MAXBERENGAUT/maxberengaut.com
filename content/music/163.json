  "write_up": "Hinds are also from Spain, and in an interview I saw them talk about the Strokes like it was the Rolling Stones talking about Muddy Waters. It\u2019s not hard to see that sort of appeal to their music, which is about making Indie Rock like they\u2019re all stuck at in the basement at one of those Korean factories which spits out heavily marketable boy bands like it\u2019s what they eat for breakfast. Unique to them are the overlapping melodies of their two vocalists and the nice and friendly way their bandmates stay in step with them.",
