  "write_up": "The Drums are the best indie band that nobody talks about like they\u2019re the best. Lead singer Jonathan Pierce wears himself on his sleeve, gay love and death obsession and all, but what makes the band truly great is how that showman bravado combines with the rest of the band\u2019s streamlined New Order sensibility, how song after song carries pop music milestones (catchiness, melodies, personal revelations) in its breath seamlessly. As I am not gay, I am unable to fully connect to the romantic pain on display here, but I understand it and I respect it.",
