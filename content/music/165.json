  "write_up": "Aesthetics are nice, they give you a chance to attach a personal enjoyment to something from only a second or two of consumption. Pop music is not just about aesthetics though, it\u2019s about precise songwriting, hard work, and innovation. So aesthetics, essentially, are that all-important initial bridge between our ingrained sense of utility and the real artistic meat of the work. From the first fifteen seconds of \u2018Ur My Bby', we understand the aesthetic appeal of its old school and lo-fi melody, but it\u2019s over the course of the rest of the song when we see all the pieces really come together, even without any words.",
