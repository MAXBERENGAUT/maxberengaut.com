  "write_up": "The Beatles are pretty cool. It\u2019s hard to name another act more directly influential on the wider scope of popular music. \u2018Be Above It\u2019 shows Tame Impala\u2019s modern reinvention of their stylistic technique, most clearly referential in the whiny yet emotionally enriching vocals. The \u2018Gotta Be Above It\u2019 spoken affirmation reverberating throughout latches us down, so that those beautiful waves of synths can really release those things that build up inside of us.",
