  "write_up": "Palehound sounds pretty similar to Jay Som. I guess it\u2019s why they made Bachelor. Anyway besides the voice, she is just as if not more structurally talented to Jay Som, understanding how atmosphere can work with vocal hooks, and work too with a constantly moving bass line, to create something newly original. I hope in the coming decade this particular style of queer women indie music headspace only becomes bigger and bigger.",
