  "write_up": "Atlanta in the 2010s, and most likely in the coming decade too, was one of those great hotspots for musical innovation, so much so that small acts on the periphery could do things nowhere else in the country could dream of. Danger Incorporated haven\u2019t blown up like other acts, but they were pretty popular within that insular community, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. Their work is emotionally acute, confidently performed, and backed by production that feels modern and professional all at once. \u2018Ashley Olsen\u2019s lyrical back and forth culminates with a great reprise on the final chorus.",
