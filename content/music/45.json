  "write_up": "Not many pop songs avoid melodrama. \u2018Kill for Love\u2019 doesn\u2019t even try. It approaches its heartfelt topics like it\u2019s a first-time experience for everyone involved, including the listeners. One of the most gleeful electronic guitar hooks you\u2019ll ever hear, tied up with a proud vocal performance which reimagines its Beach House influences into something even more purely melancholy.",
