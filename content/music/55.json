  "write_up": "This review was written by Sean T. Collins, on Pitchfork, for the review of Slowdive (S/T), 2017. 'Nature metaphors come so readily to mind when listening to shoegaze\u2014clouds, stars, skies, storms, oceans, whirlwinds, maelstroms\u2014that it\u2019s easy to believe that, like the weather it evokes, it just sort of happens. Invest in the right guitar pedals, put the right breathy spin on your vocals, and bam\u2014instant Loveless, or close enough to fool a stoned and heartsick teenager. It\u2019s as easy as walking out your front door and letting the spring air greet you. For some bands that may well be all there is to it. But song by song, moment by moment, sometimes even note by note, Slowdive do it better. There\u2019s nothing elaborate in the bassline for Slomo, the opening track of their first album in 22 years, given the thick bed of guitars it bounces on. Just seven notes, the sixth of which leaps unexpectedly up an octave instead of continuing the bassline\u2019s descent. Or at the end of 'Slomo,' when Rachel Goswell\u2019s voice pulls off a similar trick, first when she takes over lead vocals from Neil Halstead, then when she starts singing them at the very top of her register\u2026 all it takes are these small but striking detours to remind us that this glorious noise is the work of human hands and the skill that move them.'",
