  "write_up": "Gucci Mane is a trap music star whose music resonates with every generation of fans. First finding his ground in the late 2000s, Gucci still had his slurred confidence in 2012, masking uniquely clever lyrical grinds, making powerful music without ever really making it sound like it\u2019s trying to be. His subtle taste for background ad-libs and the dope boy aesthetic are all pieces of the wider artistic weaves inseparable from trap music. He is simultaneously the best example of the artistic breadth of the genre as well as its worst example of an ill-disguised dislike for artistic coherency.",
