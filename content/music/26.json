  "write_up": "A male-female duo where the woman deserves every ounce of the credit for the music. Vietnam is one of those songs that has its own inner legacy, like Middlemarch or something. It's brilliant, though unfortunately, sick at its core. I would understand anybody who finds it impossible to listen to Crystal Castles. For me, personally, I like it so much I absolve it of its sins, and instead try to turn that appreciation into hatred for the disgusting pervert who helped make it.",
