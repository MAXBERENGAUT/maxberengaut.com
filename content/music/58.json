  "write_up": "Girlpool are one of those indie success stories that are almost immediately understandable once you spend twenty or so seconds listening to their music. The sort of quiet purposefulness of Vampire Weekend mixed with the new female-led wave of indie music, so in short, a commitment to understanding emotions through the lens of pop music. Its subtle power enters into the caverns of your head and sets up shop, not bothering to check if you\u2019d like it too or not.",
