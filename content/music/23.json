  "write_up": "Frankie Cosmos has a voice that cracks continually, but her perfect intonation style makes us fall for her all the same. The guitars are never wowing, but they allow Frankie Cosmos\u2019s multi-tracked diarisms to sink into the heads of the listeners. Her lyrical content is unique and deep, as she ponders friendships and existence and heartbreak and fate within the box of an indie-pop group.",
