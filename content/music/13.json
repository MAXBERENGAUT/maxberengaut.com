  "write_up": "Beach House are all about world creation, like the Cocteau Twins were back in the day. Never before had they done it so well as with \u2018Levitation\u2019. I sort of don\u2019t really want to talk about how I found this song, actually one of their most popular. I was a sophomore in college smoking too much weed, getting over a girl who wasn't interested in me (despite my slow-dying hope). I added all of their music, pressed shuffle on all their songs, and put my phone in my pocket. I was standing out on my balcony, arms over the rails, looking over the small parking lot and the quiet camped alleyway of off-campus student housing. The natural world felt hot on my back. I thought I discovered actual meaning.",
