  "write_up": "This is the sort of music my friend Kerry makes, turning weed and depression into art, and while he hasn\u2019t made a song like Mirage yet, it\u2019s probably only a matter of time. The short run time adds so much, somehow, turning an impulsive launch of synths into a virtual pop mirage. The closest anyone has come yet to understanding the connection between art and pop, and then, pop and unrequited love.",
