  "write_up": "Pinegrove at their peak was indie boy heaven. It\u2019s like, look! Here\u2019s this guy who loves women and is able to communicate that while remaining inside the loose genre trappings of indie rock, and it doesn\u2019t sound anything like Neutral Milk Hotel. Our hearts leap at shit like that. Of course, at the end of the day it\u2019s just nice words and a unique musical sensibility in one, and that happens all the time with musicians who aren\u2019t like us. It\u2019s nice when it happens though.",
