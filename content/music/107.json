  "write_up": "I am not the biggest Parquet Courts guy in the world. Honestly, this is the only song by them I\u2019ve gotten into. Sometimes, when it\u2019s a somewhat unknown song like \u201cthis one\u201d, it means it\u2019s only a matter of time before I\u2019ve listened to every song they\u2019ve made. They are a New York band, but in this song they summon the American Southern mythic power easily, simply, and most impressively, objectively. It\u2019s a flat out artistic masterclass in every single moment of its lengthy runtime.",
  "lyric": "What southern judge do you know, comfortingly gently / Who jails white men who defend their home",
  "song": "Uncast Shadow of a Southern Myth",
