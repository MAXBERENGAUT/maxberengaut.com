  "write_up": "Lauded generally online as the 'start' of what melodic rap could do, Citgo is still as powerful as it likely was (I was listening to the arctic monkeys back then instead) the day it came out. Citgo is one of the premier landmarks for cloud rap. Chief Keef is a visionary artist who deserves to be listed in the same breath of Animal Collective, Akira Kurosawa, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez (and he\u2019s still only 26 years old).",
