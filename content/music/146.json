  "write_up": "After the mainstream explosion in 2016, Soundcloud Rap went into hiding, slowly building itself back up again through Pluggnb, until rappers like Vonte, BoofPaxkMooky, 1600J, Tony Shhnow and 10KDunkin fully arrived, artistic hearts intact. Vonte\u2019s innate stylistic reliance on heavy autotune takes some getting used to, but on songs like \u2018On God\u2019, he finds the hidden emotional pathos absent from much of mainstream rap, powered all the time by a brilliant, spectral beat.
