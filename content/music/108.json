  "write_up": "Arca has built a beautiful career for herself as one of the most peerless electronic music innovators, but my favorite song of hers is one of her firsts, which is like a modern retelling of New Order, pulsating and vibrant without forcing a thing. There are so many reasons for artists to move away from making pop music gold, but its songs like this that make clear how powerful \u2018Yeezus\u2019, which has her fingerprints all over it, was as a pop masterpiece.",
