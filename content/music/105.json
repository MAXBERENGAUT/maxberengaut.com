  "write_up": "Folktronica is one of those made up genres which\u2019s label masks what\u2019s actually going on. Folk music, the most obviously boring music genre out right now, being mixed with the second most obviously boring music genre in electronic music, is guaranteed to flop. Why do people not understand that the only thing that matters is artistic skill and vision? The sensibility to see how electronic music can accentuate folk music, and vice versa, is really what Bon Iver\u2019s most crucial talent is. 29 #Strafford APTS uses lo-fi glitches to add artistic value to its messy emotion, with pure purpose and passion. That\u2019s what\u2019s going on, not some newfound age of music.",
