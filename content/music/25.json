  "write_up": "One of Bladee\u2019s most disrespected talents is his feel for innovative songwriting, how to work the hooks and the specific volume of his layered autotune-heavy vocal tracks over the minimalistic imprint of the production. It\u2019s pop music at its very best. The opening synths, made by longtime collaborator Whitearmor, are some of the most emotionally illuminating sounds I\u2019ve ever heard in music. Yes, it\u2019s objectively meaningless, just like the vocals, but when it\u2019s all put together so skillfully, it\u2019s revelatory like nothing else out there.",
