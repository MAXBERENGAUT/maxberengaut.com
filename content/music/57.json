  "write_up": "Slow-building songs have this weird knack of being looped together with all other slow-building songs. I don\u2019t really personally see the connection between songs like \u2018He Would Have Laughed\u2019 and \u2018Exit Music (For a Film)\u2019, but I guess I see why people would bother to point it out. There\u2019s rare examples of recent bands so uniquely gifted that they are able to sustain a listener\u2019s interest for a meandering six or so minutes. Sometimes it takes a specific time and place where you\u2019re forced to commit your attention to it. For me it was at the back of a city bus in Chile. Lyrically and structurally, \u2018He Would Have Laughed\u2019 surprises at almost every turn, despite its energy never really picking up. But who cares about that.",
