  "write_up": "No rapper has come close to this world, not even Future. This is just pure artistic originality, a wonderful sensibility for how trap music can grow and build in the heart, as well as unprecedented devotion to unpredictability. I love how full and emotionally vibrant it is. It sounds virtually perfect, like every vocal tic and wavering synth was placed there with the mind of a single Picasso. Never before has there been a rapper more at home in negative space.",
  "lyric": "A wise man told me nothing / \u2026. He said those snitches get stitches",
  "song": "Raw (Might Just)",
