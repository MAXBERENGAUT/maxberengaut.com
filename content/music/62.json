Sing the words, jump up and down a bit, stand with your arms around shoulders in a circle with everyone else while the drunk and self-absorbed kids dance in the middle of it, you got it, don\u2019t worry, because later on, you\u2019ll be in bed and you\u2019ll feel that really wasn\u2019t too bad.",
