  "write_up": "Earl Sweatshirt came back from the island and chose darkness over impishness, a wild artistic swerve which made sense then and makes sense now. He\u2019s honest with the limits of his world, how alienation is something almost inescapable, and with how he likens his struggles to the wide rangy history of human issues. The production is so greasy the vividly depressed snickers are strangely like cake toppings.",
  "lyric": "Feel like I\u2019m the only one pressing to grow upwards",
  "song": "Faucet",
