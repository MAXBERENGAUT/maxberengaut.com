  "write_up": "The night has been ignored artistically for the most part. People know it\u2019s different from the day, but few have actively tried to recreate that difference in the form of art. Archy Marshall has spent his musical career proving that to be a gross injustice to our human experience. The song crawls along its pace, moved by a dry sort of unwilling persistence to its duty, swimming up from underneath our communal subconscious. The words and little hiccups in the production latch onto pockets of our memory like those slowly thinning sensations we get while wanting to go to bed.",
