  "write_up": "Guitar pop and indie music in general fans, you can eat your heart out with An Ettendant Ana. In terms of influences, it wouldn\u2019t make much sense to get into it, but Alvvays fans will love it most likely. The French have been important to popular music like no other non-English speaking country, showing that qualified artistic sensibilities can arise from anywhere on earth. To borrow from that popular American movie which was clearly in love with French culture: \u2018Not everyone can be a great cook, but, anyone can be a great cook\u2019.",
