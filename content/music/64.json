  "write_up": "Arcade Fire, like fellow Canadians Broken Social Scene, show singular artistic vision is not necessarily unavailable for bands larger than four or five or even ten. The Suburbs is an album full of life, dramatic, self-serious, and absolutely fulfilling to listen too. What I like most about \u2018Ready to Start\u2019 is the unfiltered honesty, about art and show business, about North American life and boredom, and about what music is supposed to do about all of that in the first place. (Be enjoyed).",
