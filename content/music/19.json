  "write_up": "The Ooz is one of the most cohesive albums of the decade, most of the songs drifting in between dreams and the underworld of a dark city. Emergency Blimp is its wake-up call, bringing in fast-paced guitars, brilliant vocal melodies straight out of \u2018Easy Easy\u2019, as well as a drug-related lyrical run-on simmering with trauma.",
