  "write_up": "A legend of Atlanta music, Trouble was luckily able to secure an entire album with Mike WiLL Made-It to show out before he passed. Its best songs, like Hurt Real Bad, are about how pain sinks into our skin until we can no longer feel it. These songs tacitly explore the long standing blues tradition of the American South, and are subtly spiritualistic pieces of a mind that's gradually losing itself in the streets.",
