  "write_up": "Women have a special power over men. I wish it wasn\u2019t true. Honestly, it kinda sucks. \u2018Riri\u2019 is about how they can make everything alright, about how their passion and attention can feel like the only things on earth that can keep you going. It has the greatest ad-lib ever, placed on the song solely to accentuate that emotion. It\u2019s a song that gleefully explores the most underground aspects of our human experience. While Young Thug only really seems to be able to access this special artistic power through his sexual compulsions, he is still able to access it, unlike anybody else alive.",
