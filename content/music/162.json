  "write_up": "Soundcloud has long secured a place in the halls of music history. Without it artists like Bladee and genres like Nightcore wouldn\u2019t be important. It\u2019s true, important is subjective, but it\u2019s still a platform for artists dedicated to the new. When mainstream music scene is allergic to desperation, it opens up space for other people to reach the countless others out there who also feel alienated. Hinoni, and specifically Capoxxo, have more or less invented a new genre, Blink-182 pop-punk cloud rap, and if they weren\u2019t necessarily the ones who invented it, they\u2019re some of the ones who popularized it.",
