  "write_up": "Soccer Mommy, one of the classic indie rock acts of this decade, is an extremely accomplished songwriter, though many of her songs tend to recircle ideas already etched over by other artists. \u2018Last Girl\u2019 is a little different, it doesn\u2019t really seem to have any purpose other than to whine, but it is uncomfortably emotionally true. Not many men (none) would dedicate a song so tenderly to a love rival. Jealousy is an emotion that people tend to misunderstand; at its core, it\u2019s just unfortunate awareness of what seems glaringly obvious.",
