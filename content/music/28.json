  "write_up": "Wavves is the unprecedented king of surf-pop, the sort of stuff Brian Wilson would want to make today if he had been born fifty years later. Of course, then, Wavves wouldn\u2019t exist I guess, at least not in this form, as this type of music is the closest I\u2019ve ever seen someone get to independent sonic freedom. Every layer and building block of this song, of which there are many, feels carefully thought out in order to unlock that dopamine chest in our prefrontal cortex.",
