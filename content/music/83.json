  "write_up": "Lil Tracy filtered his weed addiction/depression into pure angst on this cut that\u2019s somewhere in that deep space between streaming services and SoundCloud where he made his name. It also shows his lyrical side. Listening to Tracy at times feels like listening to a human-like squirrel after they\u2019ve gotten to the end of the dark blackhole of emotional trauma. Nice and wonderful, but a little troubling.",
