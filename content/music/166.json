  "write_up": "\u2018Voodoo\u2019 has a lot of faults, probably more faults than any other song on this list. It\u2019s still a special song, because Keef is literally the only person on earth who can make unique creepy-clown production (think back half of Graze - Animal Collective), into dark epics. Not only is he the only person strange enough to have this kind of vision, but he is also the only person with the wherewithal to make it happen, to have the ability to turn vivid ideas from the subconscious into works of art.",
