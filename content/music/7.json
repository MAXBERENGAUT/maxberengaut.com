I find it hard to believe \u2018Ribs\u2019 could ever not be someone\u2019s favorite song off \u2018Pure Heroine\u2019. It\u2019s slow-building, confidently arranged, and packed with an insane amount of savant-like emotional insight and innocent youthful purity. It\u2019s the sort of thing that 17 year olds should never be able to make. So, it\u2019s basically magic.",
