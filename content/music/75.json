  "artist": "St. Vincent",
  "year": "2014",
  "write_up": "St. Vincent grew up musically in Sufjan Steven\u2019s band, and one thing she took from him was the impetus to trailblaze a singular artistic path. Her music is at times electronic, others almost indie folk, mostly all alternative, but her vocals and her choice in lyrics always show her to be much more complex than a lot of her peers. \u2018Birth In Reverse\u2019 explores, like many other artists, an uniquely American static, without the overhanded righteousness that many others prefer.",
