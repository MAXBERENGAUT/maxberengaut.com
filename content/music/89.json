  "write_up": "Bear1Boss has a gift, a real gift for style and presence, infused by the rich musical culture of Atlanta but also uniquely energetic in its own right. It\u2019s catchy and memorable like many people seem scared to ever be. When I was really listening to this song, I would repeat it over and over again on my way to class for like a month straight. Only Thug, Future, and Keef, maybe Kodak, maybe Kanye, have ever got to that point with me. I remember hoping and hoping for some new artist to get into to, and there he was, flying across the sky on the cover of 2021\u2019s \u2018Super Fancy 2\u2019.",
