  "write_up": "Movie samples, long extended intros with mixtape tags everywhere, yep, it\u2019s a SoundCloud song. D. Savage couldn\u2019t make the switch to the mainstream, but he\u2019s so comfortable here, laid back in the beat, a natural and wavy atmosphere all around him. It\u2019s like a strong punch to the gut when he comes on the song.",
  "lyric": "Hit \u2018em with the stick, hit em with the pump / Watch his body flip, we don\u2019t give a shit",
