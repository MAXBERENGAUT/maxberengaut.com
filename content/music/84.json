  "write_up": "Kendrick Lamar took the decade like almost no other artist, let alone rapper. Pulitzer Prize win aside, his analytical approach blew hip-hop up to the wide screen, using unique production to make deep-searing political commentary on the American mess, along the way making a fascinatingly easy transition into pop music ubiquity. On songs like \u2018Hood Politics\u2019, you can understand why he\u2019d be considered the greatest rapper alive, because really, what other music out there is like this? Seamless world play, melodic perseverance, and incisive social reflection executed this well hasn\u2019t really been done by anybody else this generation.",
