  "write_up": "MexikoDro is one of the most influential producers of the decade, and his sensibility is all over Broke Boi, which glides through glittery keys in the light of Carti\u2019s incessant, reckless confidence. Carti\u2019s flow here steals the show, his intonations making the most basic flexes memorable and irresistibly catchy.",
