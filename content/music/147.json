  "year": "2012",
  "write_up": "Starting with a soft, melancholy Cocteau Twins sample, The Weeknd builds a sonic world through the expansiveness of his vocals. He isn\u2019t as dynamic (or unintelligible) as Elizabeth Fraser, but he understands how to construct cascades of emotion, which swirl beneath him as he proudly rejects an ex-lover.",
  "lyric": "You probably thought that you\u2019d break my heart.",
  "song": "The Knowing",
