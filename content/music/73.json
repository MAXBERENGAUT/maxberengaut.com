  "write_up": "Builds sonic worlds, but antithetically to how it\u2019s normally done, stacking incongruences on top of each other, to reach an ultimate sonic whirlwind that you just can\u2019t fully nail down. The vocals aren\u2019t inaudible, it\u2019s just that the song structure is impossible to fully wrap your head around because there\u2019s so much stuff going on at once. You have to keep playing it over and over again to figure it out.",
