  "write_up": "Adrianne Lenker is more or less the Bob Dylan of 2010s indie music. Big Thief is at their best when the band fades into the background and the pathos of her lyrics are at the forefront, but by fade I don\u2019t mean disappear, I mean dissolve into the blank space sprawled across the song. Part of what allows that to happen is the creation of stakes, the formulation of tension, or, in other words, the band itself. Not many bands have ever worked at this level.",
