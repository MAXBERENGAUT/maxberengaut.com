  "write_up": "Kanye West made a name for himself by flipping soul samples, and when he got into the spotlight, he showed that first success was only really a sign of a much greater talent. He understands theatrics like no other artist, and nobody has come closer to fulfilling that for-all-time type of prophecy which every hit artist is unknowingly also given access too. He is the only artist this century who can truly say they\u2019ve bared the full extent of their soul to the world. Amazing is the only word for it.",
