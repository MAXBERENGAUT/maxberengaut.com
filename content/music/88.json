  "write_up": "I like Spanish music; with the way they can use the lovely angles of the language itself to build up the song up from within. I just can\u2019t get into Reggaeton, besides Bad Bunny, whose worldly skill is too self-evident to needlessly explain. When I find Spanish songs I love, like Destroyer\u2019s \u2018El Rito\u2019, or this one, \u2018No\u2019, by Nicolas Jaar, it feels so special that I end up replaying it over and over in order to study the strange grammar and familiar accent. \u2018No\u2019, about Pinochet and the constant cloud of the American capitalist intervention into Latin America, crackles and floats, ending up levitating above the crowded streets of Santiago like in that old movie \u2018Soy Cuba\u2019.",
