  "write_up": "Old times have a certain sort of charm. It\u2019s likely their simplicity. Classic pop music is no different, and Shannon & the Clams know that simplicity was often just a product of hard songwriting work. While they had no intention of reinventing the wheel or leading American popular music into a new age, this band only wanted to recreate the 50s jukebox diner aesthetic of pop music and hey, I\u2019m alright.",
