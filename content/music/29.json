  "write_up": "The Dirty Projectors created what is probably the best album of the 2000s in \u2018Bitte Orca\u2019 and anyone who\u2019s gotten into their music knows it wasn\u2019t a fluke. Dave Longstreth and Amber Coffman were a powerful combo while they were still together, maybe one of the most powerful in all of popular music history. Longstreth\u2019s deceptively simple guitar and percussion sensibility combines with Coffman\u2019s brilliant voice and brute lyrical force to create an unforgettable ode to social insecurity.",
  "lyric": "I\u2019m gonna try combing my hair in a thousand ways / Maybe he will notice and maybe look my way",
