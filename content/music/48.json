  "write_up": "It\u2019s not a new thing for music critics to write about the places that music can take us back too. I\u2019m not trying to be new though, I\u2019m just trying to write about my life through music. Fall Off reminds me of my UMD student dorm in the summer of 2018 from while I was at architecture camp. For five or so minutes, 03 Greedo sings ecstatically about how the world will just have to stop for him, even while everything around him is being taken from him.",
