  "write_up": "Smoking weed is fun when you find the songs you\u2019re never supposed to find. In the middle of his strange and different \u2018The Slaughter Tape\u2019, 21 Savage has a song with Atlanta scene stalwart Key! that is the first time I\u2019ve ever felt happily like the money-crazed migrants in 1849 California. Extremely quotable lines, genius production, and the decade\u2019s most stone-faced rapper showing his little seen melodic talent for autotune.",
  "lyric": "Yeah, I\u2019m a liar, I\u2019m a dog, she a silly bitch",
  "song": "Out the Bowl (feat. Key!)",
