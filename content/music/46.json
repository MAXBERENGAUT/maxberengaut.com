  "write_up": "What seemed at the time to be the peak of modern hip-hop, \u2018good kid, m.A.A.d city\u2019, turned out to be true. The confluence of hip-hop with urban violence is more or less its modern genre trapping, and nobody made that combination more artistically worthwhile than Kendrick. He is rightfully acknowledged as rap's greatest lyricist of the decade, but here, he somehow finds pop stardom too, submerged inside a violent relentlessness basking in the urban sprawl of Los Angeles.",
