  "write_up": "One of the most beautiful opening samples I\u2019ve ever head leads into a almost unintelligible multi-tracked Black Kray vocal performance that precedes most of what SoundCloud rap became after his entrance. Here, anyone who complains about the lyrics, or the somewhat clear limitations of the vocals, is missing the point entirely. This song is all about feeling, and what it can create in our hearts, or what art can become for all of us, something that feels special only to us and our own unique life experiences.",
