  "write_up": "Palm\u2019s music sounds like it comes through at least two or three otherworldly radio transistors. Here the Caribbean keyboard is similar to the vibes of aforementioned Arbes, but the songwriting conceit is different, it finds its pockets of pop in the havoc of its world, not the equanimity, which makes it crazy fun to listen to. What is the deal with dog milk? I don\u2019t know, honestly, but that isn\u2019t the point of the song. Instead, it\u2019s the constantly surprising crescents and drops that somehow never fall off or feel organized for five whole minutes.",
