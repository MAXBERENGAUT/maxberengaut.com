  "write_up": "Lil Tracy and Lil Peep were the greatest rap duo of the decade, besides, I guess, Young Thug and Rich Homie Quan, but even then their interplay has nothing on Lil Tracy/Lil Peep who exchange between themselves so effortlessly it's as if they were the same person. The Nedarb classic production choice of flipping great indie music never turned out better.",
