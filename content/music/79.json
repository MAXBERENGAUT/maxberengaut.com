  "artist": "JPEGMAFIA",
  "year": "2018",
  "write_up": "Out of the independent Baltimore art scene comes an avant-garde future star. JPEGMAFIA prefers to self-produce, and it means that when the pop side of his music is prioritized, which it rarely is, the end result is something that nobody else on earth could ever dream of making. A long steady intro leads into one of those never ending quotable verses that are likely hip-hop\u2019s most clear contribution to popular music on the whole.",
  "lyric": "Tryin\u2019a give that dick to Kelly Conway",
