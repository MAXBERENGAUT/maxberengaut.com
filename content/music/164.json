  "write_up": "Some songs are just what they are you know, like the title just explains it, and then within twenty seconds or so, the rest of the song is clear too. \u2018Your Brain is Made of Candy\u2019 is just one of those audience pleasers that doesn\u2019t completley make sense but has palpating energy and outright catchiness. There\u2019s an emotional specificity to the title line too that keeps it in your mind long after you hear it.",
  "lyric": "Oh your brain\u2019s made of candy / At first I thought it was rancid",
