  "write_up": "There are some people who are born with an instinctive gift for singing their heart out in non-embarrassing ways. Otherwise known as talent. NBA YoungBoy is one of them, and though his personal life shows that world he grew up in is far from a thing of the past, there\u2019s a plain beauty to being able to reinterpret the harshness of life into pop music. He believes in himself as an artist, in his unique individuality particularly, and while it isn\u2019t always convincing, it makes for great music as it comes together.",
