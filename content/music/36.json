  "write_up": "It\u2019s hard to make a perfect song. Why could Sleigh Bells do it, only once? They have some great noise pop songs, but Rill Rill is something special, like from outer space special, in that it contains indie music sensibilities while also being the type of song one direction enthusiast middle school girls can enjoy too. Which never happens. Like never. Unforgettable lines keep coming and coming and coming.",
