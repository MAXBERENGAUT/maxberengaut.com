  "write_up": "Indie Rock burns with a quiet sort of passion that passerby can sometimes sense to be only passivity. I hate that. It\u2019s passive not to care, it\u2019s passive to choose money over soul, it\u2019s passive to believe in yourself and not in the world, and it\u2019s passive to choose the easy way out every time. \u2018Please\u2019 is a literal plea for others to understand, a mazy trek of a song which has emotional peaks and valleys, like real life, but as it is only a work of art and not an actual life with real human experience, people can ignore it if it just doesn\u2019t benefit their life enough to care for it.",
