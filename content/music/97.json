  "write_up": "Classic Future song, nothing revolutionary in terms of his catalogue, but for any other rapper it would be their greatest song. Seamlessly rides over classically melancholic production. Future is just outright refusing to let his usual outpouring of word garbage come out inessential or forceless, he makes it all work, turning the otherwise lifeless lyrics of drug and luxury into an unforgettable statement of identity.",
