  "write_up": "Released around the same time as the movie, Sufjan Stevens uses his distinctive prosaic style with the simplicity and eloquence that his name became synonymous with in the wake of his fantastic past released like \u2018Michigan\u2019 and \u2018Illinois\u2019. Here, like he did in the past with John Wayne Gacy, he calmly talks face-to-face with a larger-than-life American cultural figure, implicitly challenging their standard negative moral connotation. ",
  "lyric": "She took quite a beating, so you\u2019re not above cheating",
