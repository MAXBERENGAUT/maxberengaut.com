  "write_up": "2015 Future was at the peak of his dominance, confident and brutal all at once, never someone to really emotionally trust but someone whose primeval intentions are made stunningly real. The husky and labored voice he employs for the entirety of \u2018Lil Haiti Baby\u2019 is one of those slight intonational innovations that only he does so well. He makes the cruelness of the world sound like a fact of life, the dark nihilism of America like his bread and butter, artistically challenging without ever really trying to be.",
