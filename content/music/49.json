  "write_up": "I\u2019m not sure what I can really say to people who don\u2019t see Future\u2019s artistic skill. Nobody has specifically used the finer inflections of voice to reveal emotion like him. That alone makes him a fearless innovator, a hidden artist in the clothes of a blood thirsty tiger, and most of all, a wandering soul. I could ask questions like \u201cDo you like the Blues? Do you like pain in art? Do you think it\u2019s valuable to push yourself to the edge for art\u2019s sake?\u201d, but because he\u2019s known primarily by his talent for turn-up music, I would be looked at like someone who doesn\u2019t \u2018understand\u2019 his intent. But art is what matters! Not the intent! And here, on songs like purple reign, the intent is so clearly artistic that I literally have no idea what they\u2019re even on.",
