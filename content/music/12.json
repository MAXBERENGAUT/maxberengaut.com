  "write_up": "Music lovers know songs can just glue to your head. We don\u2019t really have a say in what glues either. I certainly didn\u2019t try to make this Rubblebucket song stick, it\u2019s not like they had some illustrious critically revered career, but still it stuck. After some time, besides the fun horn riff and severely talented vocals of the singer, Annakalmia Traver, something else stuck out to me. It was the best song about falling in love that I\u2019d ever heard. Most accurate, most telling, most believable. I just couldn\u2019t believe it.",
  "lyric": "(I am unabashedly in love, the kind of love that can bring me out of pain and into the world of self-certainty, a love that makes the rest of the world finally bearable. I just can't believe it.)",
  "song": "Came Out of a Lady",
