  "write_up": "Rico Nasty is unfortunately one of those rappers whose artistic heyday likely came a little before they finally got that platform which could explode them into ubiquity. Critical reviews focus on her angry songs, probably because of her gender, but on songs like \u2018Phone\u2019 I also hear an instinctive talent for subtle melody and pop hits.",
