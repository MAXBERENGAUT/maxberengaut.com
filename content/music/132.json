  "year": "2013",
  "write_up": "Before he lost his ability to control how people thought of him, Chance the Rapper had his reputation for a reason. His music is silly and earnest, but it has an unmistakably youthful driving energy. Ab-Soul delivers his feature, understanding the task well. The production is also endearingly buoyant.",
  "lyric": "She only got you as a n**** on the side / That\u2019s a n**** on the side of a side bitch, homie",
  "song": "Smoke Again (ft. Ab-Soul)",
