  "write_up": "All across this album is the evidence of a band working for nobody but themselves. It leads, in many different directions, into great pop music, but never so brutally as in \u2018They Want My Soul\u2019, which has standard chord changes and normal rock n\u2019 roll energy but without all of the pride other songs like it, on this album and elsewhere, have. Spoon will be remembered as one of the most consistent indie acts of the early 21st century, which is not a small accomplishment by any means.",
