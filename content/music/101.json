  "write_up": "Isaiah Rashad is a rare rapper for this past decade as he is difficult to pin down into a particular sub-genre. Most modern day rappers position themselves either in a specific \u2018new-wave\u2019, or as classic hip-hop stylists who can look down on new-wave rappers (if they want). Rashad\u2019s taste is anything but new-school, this beat feels like it is spiritually still in the 20th century, but he still likes originality and catchiness as much as the new-wavers do.",
