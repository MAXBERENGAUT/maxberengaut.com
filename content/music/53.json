  "write_up": "Chastity Belt, maybe clearly from the name, was one of the most creatively unique bands of the decade. Unafraid to give albums and songs impulsive and immature names like \u2018No Regerts\u2019, \u2018Nip Slip\u2019, and of course, \u2018Pussy Weed Beer\u2019, the all-female band by nature undercut any preconceived notions someone could bring to their music.",
