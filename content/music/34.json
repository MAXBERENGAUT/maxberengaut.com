  "write_up": "SOPHIE was on the verge of electronic music superstardom before her tragic death. It\u2019s hard not to see the awe-inspiring vocals and castling synths as anything but a measure of the personal strength she needed for her gender transition. It feels like coming to the very edge of a cliff, and feeling the world rushing in behind you, pushing you and pulling you back at the same time. It\u2019s very good.",
