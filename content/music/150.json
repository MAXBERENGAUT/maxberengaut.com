  "write_up": "Mac Miller, through albums like Blue Side Park, Divine Feminine, and Swimming, proved himself to be a gifted rapper. He never wows at first hearing, but he is always able to fit seamlessly into the beat. On his best songs, he finds pockets of wisdom from the back of his mind, like in Avian, where he quips \u201cTV Money / Dollar for sense of humor\u201d and \u201cNot into this conversation, I been in my head for hours, I\u2019m out.\u201d These lyrics perfectly encapstulate the (drug-related) feeling of wanting to escape our bodies:",
