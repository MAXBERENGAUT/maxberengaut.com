  "write_up": "Future/Young Thug, as the defacto Modest Mouse/Built to Spill of the Atlanta generation of rap music, have made a lot of music together, even an entire project. Sup Mate is my personal favorite, as it shows what happens when geniuses are given the space to interplay artistically with each other. So much of it feels almost ridiculously instinctual. Anyone who knows their musical style can tell it isn\u2019t an act. There are so many great throw away lines here, sticky lines, like fish guts, that make \u2018Sup Mate\u2019 an alive work of art. It's the type of song to make a sleepless bus drive from Sevilla to Valencia in the middle of the night somehow worthwhile.",
