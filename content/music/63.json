  "write_up": "Some people like to talk about cloud rap like it\u2019s something that wouldn\u2019t have existed without SpaceGhostPurrp. Purrp is obviously influential, especially on the A$AP Rocky/Clams Casino brand of cloud rap, but for me, the first cloud rap was made by Kreayshawn, a lesbian white girl from LA. \u2018I JU$T WANN4 BE YO6R FRIEND\u2019 is one of the saddest, most unique songs I\u2019ve ever heard. It recreates the emotional weight and surprising depth of the genre while not rehashing anything, using an annoying vocal filter to veil a lyrical cascade of beautiful romantic passion. Who posted the video for the song on youtube back in 2010? Black Kray.",
