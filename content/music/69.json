  "write_up": "Americans have largely ignored UK Rap, except for some features on high profile albums here and there, and of course the recent rise in drill music which at times vividly feels like an instantaneous collaboration between London and New York. It\u2019s not really that surprising when you think about it. Different people, different strokes. Gentleman is one of the only songs that transcends that barrier. The personality and the unexpected skill here, all invented from the mind of a ski masked 15-year-old, were enough for me back in the day. It has grown a lot in popularity in recent years, but even in 2017, the artistic difference was there for everyone to see.",
