  "write_up": "Courtney Barnett has a genius conversational style, here it slows down into world building. It casually takes the engaged listener around a house, and she complains about the world in ways that bother you too. Courtney Barnett understands her voice a lot more than a lot of more naturally dynamic singers do.",
  "lyric": "Aren\u2019t the pressed metal ceilings great? / \u2026 And I see the handrail in the shower",
  "song": "Depreston",
