  "write_up": "One of the most uncomfortable aspects of trap music is its drug-filled content, at times feeling like the objective purpose for the art and at others like a disturbing plea for help. The best artists are those who are able to take all of that potential negativity and convert it into pop music simply by bringing relentless energy and a never before seen level of commitment to the bit. What makes Thug even more unique is that along the way he is rewriting all the rules of rap music, intentionally but also not necessarily purposefully, all so that he can have it his way. Uno, dos, cups stuffed. Now!",
