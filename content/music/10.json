  "write_up": "The end goal of art is never really something tangible. I could tell everyone willing to listen that that this songs emasculated protagonist, (\u2018the open book\u2019), is one of the most heroic in all of popular music. For Menomena, and for me, \u2018Queen Black Acid\u2019 reaches the \u2018bottom\u2019 of art: unadulterated human connection. But as the song bemoans, who would listen? What makes it even more special is that this unusual level of emotional clarity comes from a seemingly haphazard song construction process.",
  "lyric": "You\u2019re five foot five, not a hundred pounds / I\u2019m scared to death of every single ounce",
