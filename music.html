    <p>
        Over the course of the decade, (pop) music spread out across many 
        genres, some new, some just reinterpretations of the old.  The following 
        works of art are the (pop) songs that have personally impacted me the 
        most.  As a result, the list and the ranking are biased, because they 
        are based on my opinions.  I have gaps in my music taste, just like 
        everyone else.  I also do not consider art to be at all related to the 
        artist.  Once it's created, it's no longer theirs, it's the world's and 
        I think it's unfair to judge art by the character of the artist.  I 
        believe that people, especially nowadays, need to separate their 
        personal opinions from the judgement of their art.  This article is 
        inspired of course by Pitchfork, but obviously, at its core, it's just 
        another celebration of the art of music.
