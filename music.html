    <p>
        Over the course of the decade, (pop) music spread out across many 
        genres, some new, some just reinterpretations of the old. The following 
        works of art are the (pop) songs that have personally impacted me the 
        most. Most of them I've found online or from friends. As a result, the list and the ranking are biased, because they 
        are based on my opinions. I do not consider art to be at all related to the 
        artist. In my mind once it's created, it's no longer theirs, it's the world's and 
        I think it's unfair to judge art by anything other than its subjective quality. I 
        believe that people, especially nowadays, need to separate their 
        judgement of art from its political context. But I'm biased because that's the attitude that feels most beneficial to my problems. 
        This article is inspired directly by Pitchfork, a fundamental part of the music landscape for decades, but for me it has only just 
        been a personal celebration of the art of music.
